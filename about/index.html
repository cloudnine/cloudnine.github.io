<p class="p-news">Hi, I'm Yuri Tricys, the author of Cloud Nine. I'm a researcher, technical writer, data analyst, and web developer. Cloud
Nine is a place where you can browse some of the free content I create. You can also outsource research to me directly. In fact, I encourage
you to do so. Just send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:tricys@alumni.ubc.ca? subject=Research">tricys@alumni.ubc.ca</a> with "Research" in the
subject line and I'll get back to you.</p>

<p class = "p-news">
Cloud Nine is a blog about 'stuff.' Yes, exactly, 'stuff,' in all its ambiguous grandeur. 'Stuff' can mean pretty much anything, but I'm
talking about a special kind of stuff, that kind that makes us human. You know like, 'aack,' philosophy, ethics, motivation, and work. Or,
success, family, friends, and community. Okay, you get the point. I have a license to write about pretty much anything here. And even though
you can see from the menu items on the navigation bar that Cloud Nine is about sciency stuff, and books; and even though I'm going to warn
you right now it's also about computers; rest assured, the motivation section is meant for everyone. And, it's meant to lift you up and
guide you toward your purpose. So if you do happen to read from my more technical material, keep in mind, like everything else on this blog,
that stuff is also meant to make you happier and healthier.</p>

<p class = "p-news">And that's probably the best description of Cloud Nine, really. Being happy and healthy. As Wikipedia describes it, "cloud nine is a name
colloquially given to the state of euphoria". The stuff I'm interested in puts me on Cloud Nine. And if I somehow manage to lift up even one
other person through the words I write, and the things I post. Cloud Nine will be a success.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Okay, you can see also from the description text on the main index page that Cloud Nine is about **passion.** So let me ask you, what does
passion mean to you? I'm willing to guess you're passionate about a hobby, or a job you do, or things you have. And I bet your passionate
about something or someone you care about. The former passion maybe you and I share, maybe we don't; but the latter passion, we all have in
common. And again, if I manage through sharing my passion for the stuff that I love, the stuff that invigorates and inspires me, to motivate
you to be more passionate about the stuff that you love, then I will have succeeded in my mission. Onward.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Books</p>

<p class = "p-news">I love them. I always have. When I was a kid, there was no web. I read books. It's amazing how relaxing it can be to read a good book.
Yes, it takes a lot of time, but there is something about the feel of a book in your hands, the comfort of the kind of places you go to read
books, and the ease of reading the written word printed on paper. And, just between you and me, you don't really need always to read the
entire book. Sometimes a chapter will do, sometimes a page, and sometimes only a few sentences. Read wisely. Actually, the vibrancy of the
book industry, in the face of a technological renaissance, surprised me. I thought I was alone, but noooo, books are in. They were never
out.</p>

<p class = "p-news">While, I aim one day to finish my own book, in the meantime, the book section of Cloud Nine is a place where I can share the books I've
enjoyed with you. And if you like one of the books I talk about, be sure to drop me a line by e-mail, or comment in the comment section
below.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Science</p>

<p class = "p-news">One of my favourite topics. In my younger years I studied science. You know, math, chemistry, biology, and physics. My favourite subject was
electrics. For some reason Gausses Law fascinated me. I just couldn't get over the idea of measuring flux. And magnets? No way! Magnets,
coils, induction, that stuff absolutely amazed me. Then I discovered the social sciences. And wow! What a lot of great insight into
humanity. For a long time, my favourite social science was economics. I even went in for a degree in the stuff. While I'm still a fan of
everything econ, these days I study the computer sciences, and write material and create web pages for the people I'm lucky enough to have
hire me (really amazing and wonderful people, just like you). Keep coming back here and you're sure to find more than a few posts about
computer sciences and programming languages on this blog.</p>

<p class = "p-news">About You</p>

<p class = "p-news">You, dear reader, are important. This blog is as much about you as it is about me. Nay, it's more about you. Without you there is no we.
That's the human condition. As individuals working together in organizations, living together in communities, grouped together in nations,
exchanging goods and services with one another to survive and prosper, we are nothing without each other. As communities, We don't always
get along; but we have so much in common, and so many reasons we could. And that's what matters. That there is hope for us all to get along
more and more. So when you're reading here remember, writing is as much about putting pen to paper as it is about scanning words with our
eyes and turning pages. Without the reader, there is no writer. So thank you for coming here. I hope you find something that interests you,
something I can gift to you. And if you do, I hope you will gift that something on to someone else.</p>

<p class = "p-news">About Me</p>

<p class = "p-news">Hi, my name is Yuri. I'm currently writing content for the web and building web pages for my clients, wonderful people just like you. I have
a huge interest in writing, computers, the humanities, and education. Over the years, I've studied a variety of different subjects, from
sciences, and mathematics, economics, and business, to history, literature, writing, and music. For the last seven years I've focused only
on computer sciences, in the context of web development and data science (as well as computational related research I did in association
with my university). In the future, I'd like to connect with more and more wonderful people, learn more about Golang, and keep writing. The
languages I've worked with the most (other than English) are R, Javascript, PHP, and SQL (as well Elisp...though only as needed to master my
favourite text editor.)</p>

<p class = "p-news">And there it is! Welcome to Cloud Nine. If there is something here that helps you grow your passion upwardly and outwardly, then it's all
