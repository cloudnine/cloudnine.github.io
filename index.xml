      <description>Yesterday wasn&#39;t a typical day. It was my birthday. I took a brush to the whiteboard and replaced all the TODOs with the words &#34;Read Python,&#34; in an extra large blue custom font I&#39;m calling &#39;meander.&#39; I packed one of the python books in with a couple of others and took the train to the library. My idea of a good time really is a quiet nook and a well written book.</description>

For those of you that come here for my emacs posts, don&#39;t worry, nothing has changed. I have been working on multidisciplinary studies for over twenty years. I routinely work at several types of activities. These include psychology work, finance, data science, computer programming, writing, and now also vlogging.</description>

      <description>What do Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes, and Roger Penrose have in common? Well, certainly there must have been something, but it wasn&#39;t the content of their books. Smith and Keynes were economists, Penrose is a mathematical physicist. Still, I&#39;ve mentioned them here together because in a way I&#39;m telling a story and Roger Penrose&#39;s book is to me right now in some ways what Keynes&#39;s book once was. Let&#39;s start with me and Adam Smith.</description>

      <description>This is a fantastic book. I bought it when it was first published (in 2002), and my copy is well used. The idea seems to be basically to publish everything you need to know about business, that a book can teach you, between two covers. The reality of course is that there are a lot of books on business, and many of them are inspiring and educational. Moreover, books like this one are great for people who want to understand key processes in big business, and even helpful for those who want to build better small business, but, despite what Chekhov said about it, business is not about processes, buzz words, or other people&#39;s money, it&#39;s about value exchange.</description>

      <description>Psychologists do important work, but it doesn&#39;t take one to know that people operate a lot like computers. We&#39;ve got code inside that issues a response when stimulated. The more you know the person, the more you know what responses to expect. In any organization team building improves organizational outcomes. But what is going on when team members bond?
Alignment is a concept that explains what&#39;s going on. Let each line in this chart represent a person; but more than that, let it represent their psychology, the millions of associations their mind contains between images and expectations, words and definitions, and information and responses.</description>

      <description>Below are some notes covering among other things why I got into Emacs, where I got my version, and how my configuration is organized. As mentioned before, other text editors in use today, like Atom, IntelliJ Idea, or Sublime Text are awesome, and offer also great selections of unique packages. Atom, for example, has some super useful snippet packages. You can convert them into Yasnippet format (an Emacs snippet package), but it&#39;s a hassle.</description>

      <description>Habits can be bad, like when they deter progress toward your current set of goals, and they can be good, like when they move you closer to your goals or align you with them (if, for example, your goal is to attain a certain state of being). Habits include things like the way you spend your time, the way you think about things, and the way you communicate. They determine where you are going.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s All This About Text Editors? I always used to ask, why do people post about their text-editors? These days I know the reason. Computers are lightening fast, using them isn&#39;t. You need to leave what you are doing to turn on another piece of software. You have to search for files. You&#39;re constantly having to remember how a process works, or search around the IDE to figure out how to do something again.</description>

      <description>Natural sciences in usual circumstances are wonderfully predictable; what goes up must come down. Economists since Walras have been promoting the profitable illusion that economics is a natural science. Today, more than anytime in history, that charade is obviously bunk. US stocks have gone up but not down. This has analysts, traders, economists, and pretty much everyone else asking the same questions. Why aren&#39;t they coming down? When will they? Should I buy US stocks?</description>

      <description>Rarely have free trade debaters--on all sides--had better opportunities to wag tongues. The long-standing era of free trade deals that in Canada started with the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement in 1987 (CUSFTA), superseded by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, has run squarely into a pronounced US protectionist revival that glaringly threatens the now deeply integrated global trade regime. This is not, by the way, an uncontested protectionist movement.</description>

      <description>What is the Best Age To Invest? According to value investors, like Warren Buffet, the secret sauce of finance can be explained in five simple words:
Investing is all about timing. The five simple words that contain the secret to investing like a billionaire are: The time value of money. While money doesn&#39;t exactly grow on trees, it does actually grow like a tree-a big, green, Christmasy [acceptable?], money tree. Yes, most people eventually learn the sheer power of savings and compound interest, but few people learn it early enough to use it wisely.</description>

      <description>The price of a metric ton of cobalt, the precious metal used in lithium batteries, increased 60% in the last year to $81,500 USD, a 264% increase since its all time low in February of 2016. Higher prices have lifted present valuations of cobalt bearing properties and attracted capital into the metal. Typically, when a commodity booms in price supply increases until the price falls. In 2017, however, analysts predicted high prices through 2022, based on supply-side restrictions.</description>

      <description>What is an ETF? Electronically traded funds are close-end funds that trade on a stock exchange. They are managed through a creation and redemption scheme that ties their contents to those of an index, or selection of investments that meet specific criteria. The value of an ETF is determined by market forces. When the value deviates from the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying investments, traders trade on the arbitrage opportunity.</description>

      <description>Despite what some people will tell you, the recent sell-off in the stock market was not a result of rising bond yields (as I said before rising bond yields are more likely to have delayed the sell-off). Yes, bond yields now are more volatile, and so are stocks; and yes, money moving between the two and from the sidelines has an impact on that volatility; but, there are two stronger theories, in my opinion, explaining the sell-off now.</description>

      <description>It is honorable to respect all peoples, given they are not acting outside the social contract, nor seeking to usurp unjustly another&#39;s rights or freedoms.
The law protects people in societies and enables societies to function. To the extent it remains to do so, it should be upheld at every turn. When there are laws that do not serve all citizens in a society equally, those laws should be challenged and amended.</description>

      <description>The communications revolution is no longer promising to shift production possibility frontiers outwardly, it is doing so rapidly. But there is a second shift we have not seen yet, and that&#39;s the big data shift. The capacity for organizations to improve decisions by rendering the changing digital footprint into meaningful direction, is going to reduce economic distortions in a number of ways. Firms will be able to match customers with products more efficiently.</description>

      <description>The data revolution is impacting government in a number of ways. The foremost is known as &#39;smart government&#39;, which is a reference to the way governments manage the data they have and the way they make that management and the services that go with it available to their clients (constituents in a democracy). The second impact, also intelligent, is known as the &#39;smart city.&#39;
Smart government is a concept championed by the Estonian government (our example), which won the United Nations Public Service Award, in the category of Promoting Whole of Government Approaches in the Information Age, for their online business registry.</description>

      <description>Enhanced financial regulation typically comes with intended and unintended consequences. Directive 2004/39/EC, the Market for Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), for example, successfully increased competition among financial instrument trading organizations in Europe. This brought down consumer prices and narrowed margins. It also sent market participants looking to move large blocks of shares into dark pools, where trade data are not made public.
There will be intended and unintended consequences from MiFID&#39;s successor, MiFID2, which is anticipated to be in effect by January 2018.</description>

      <description>Numerous studies have examined what intangible and tangible factors might cause one organization to outperform others over a period of time. There is no question that ideas and talent are invaluable, but it is no longer any surprise that the single most important factor affecting organizational performance is organizational psychology. Here are a few examples:
Ray Dalio runs Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. In Connecticut, he&#39;s got 1500 people, some of whom are the best and brightest brains in the financial sector, but does Ray cite his PhDs, research acumen, and process as his number one a comparative advantage?</description>

      <description>Information technologies and the data they create are changing the world rapidly in a multitude of ways. The legal profession, one of the most traditional and adverse to change, is beginning to adapt. A new breed of data savvy lawyers are entering legal circles everywhere and bringing with them an inertia from new technologies.
Firstly, the legal profession stands to gain from those data driven insights that are common across organizations, like more accurately targeted marketing, more informed case selection, more efficient internal procedures, and pricing models that minimize both losses of producer surplus, and dead-weight losses.</description>

      <description>National and international level statistics that report macroeconomic indicators, like nominal and real inflation, international transaction flows, and trade statistics, are relied on by market participants, policy makers and stakeholders as inputs to critical decisions. More often than not, macroeconomic statistics are taken as reliable, after-all, those are our official statistics, right?. But just how reliable are they? Unfortunately, the answer is that aligning statistics with underlying realities is a challenging task, and mainstream macroeconomic statistics should, even in the best of cases, be taken with a grain of salt.</description>

      <description>Big data means billions if not trillions of observations recorded daily. Sophisticated data infrastructures and advanced algorithms reveal new insights into our fast changing world, but only for those massive organizations with the transaction frequency and the know how to extract them, right?
The question is one of relevance. While big data benefits for large organizations are readily tangible--like in the case where retailers want to know when customers are more likely to purchase which products, or what optimal prices will move discounted products in a set time frame--smaller organizations sometimes just don&#39;t see how the data revolution is important to them.</description>

      <description>Data science improves organizational function, but it isn&#39;t always cheap. Scientific data analysis enables organizations to develop more internally efficient business systems. They can more easily reach potential stakeholders and engage them. Data informed organizations can prepare forward, more accurately refine and refocus strategies, and more effectively manage risks. The problem is data science itself is an investment heavy human resource, and those costs are passed on to the employer. Trainees need a strong background in probability and statistics, and expertise in a speciality subject, like political science, medicine, engineering, or economics.</description>

      <description>What is economic policy? If economics can be described as the study of the allocation of scarce resources among agents, economic policy can be described as the public rules and regulations that guide that allocation. Wherever a society is governed with laws, there will be laws that influence the economic prosperity of constituents, producers, and suppliers, as well as the distribution of resources among agents within the economy. Those rules constitute economic policy.</description>

      <description>What is maths programming? Mathematical programming, or computational programming, is the process of translating mathematically representable problems into computer languages then harnessing the power of computers to solve them. Along with the Internet, and task facilitation, mathematical programming is probably the most important contribution from the modern computer to human evolution. There are many kinds of mathematical programming techniques. Among these are: linear and non-linear programming, integer programming, mixed complementary problems, networks, goal programming, multiple objective optimization, queuing theory, regression analysis, and many more.</description>

      <description>What is decision analysis? Decision analysis is a subcategory of decision science. Ultimately, all data science could be classified as decision science, because the entire point of data analytics and informatics is to enable better decision making processes to yield better outcomes from decisions. While decision science and decision analysis cannot eliminate the possibility of sub-optimal outcomes, they are in themselves useful if not mandatory processes. They can, for example, enable teams or decision makers to move forward with confidence in their assessments of decision variable behaviour across decision parameters, and thus with more reasonable expectation of probable outcomes.</description>

      <description>What is optimization Optimization is about making choices that lead to first best outcomes. Mathematically, optimization is usually described with differential calculus, though when functions are linear, and problems are adequately fit substitution can lead to optimal solutions. In mathematics, optimization first requires the delineation of an objective function, a dependent function meant to be maximized or minimized through variations in the independent functions that predict it. Solving optimization problems therefore requires identifying maximum or minimum points on the objective function and qualifying those points as local or global maximums or minimums.</description>

      <description>What is macroeconomics Macroeconomics is the field of economics that deals with aggregated quantities. Microeconomics, for example, might deal with firm level economics, while macroeconomics might deal with aggregate firms level economics, the economics of all the firms in an economy together. Macroeconomics therefore includes the study of national level and supranational level economics.
What kind of indicators are macroeconomic? Macroeconomic indicators include trade indicators, like the trade balance, and trade openness, but also indicators that describe other facets of the economy.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudnine.github.io/archives/2018-01-18-what-is-internation-trade/</guid>
      <description>What is international trade? International trade is the movement of goods across national borders. Because bilateral exchange rates change frequently, international trade is watched closely by national and supranational governments. Small changes in currency pair spreads can impact the movement of goods across borders and, as a consequence, the health of a nation&#39;s domestic industry and its employment levels.
How do organizations measure international trade? Physical goods (commodity trade) are tracked by governments when they enter various economic and trade zones within an economy.</description>

      <description>What is modelling? Modelling is an important part of decision science. Modellers make simplified representations of reality to produce judgements about reality and guide real decisions. Models can be abstract and theoretical, or data driven and empirical. Both categories can be prescriptive, predictive, or descriptive.
Why model? Modelling is a cost-effective way to test the successes and failures of potential projects without committing large-scale resources. Modelling is also useful as means of building support necessary to successfully launch projects.</description>

      <description>What are statistics? Statistics are transformations of data through calculation. While in theory any calculation done with data yields a statistic, in practice statistics are associated with scientific and field specific calculations. For example, during preparation phase your data is frequently explored and analysed using simple plotting techniques that present meaningful descriptive statistics from the data or data subset, like the mean, median, and/or quartile ranges. As another example, in macroeconomics, various calculations with data yield well known statistics like GDP, inflation, or trade balance by sector.</description>

      <description>What is data wrangling? Data wrangling is the process of preparing data for analysis or computation. It includes transforming data into various formats and statistical derivations, cleaning data to account for missing observations, clumsy data types, or outright errors, and arranging data into workable categorized data sets.
When should data be cleaned? Anyone working with data knows it needs to be cleaned many times along the data pipeline. After data is collected, it must be wrangled before it is stored.</description>

      <description>What is data science? The science of data promises to change the world, but many of us do not know what data science is. This segement gives you our answer.
Data science is the science of data analytics in the context of scientific query. The data scientist first asks scientific questions, then gathers data relevant to those questions, and finally applies a variety of computer processes and statistical and probabilistic theories to derive answers to those questions.</description>

      <description>As Krugman might say, &#34;...it&#39;s in the market, stupid.&#34; The most influential economy in the world is poised to raise interest rates, but not because of inflation. Central banks in major parts of the world are still at the zero bound, and core prices are behaving as they should when targeted only because liquidity is trapped on balance sheets as inventory. What happened? Why did monetary easing take half a decade to jump-start the US dollar economy?</description>

      <description>The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) continues to reprimand contemporary central banking culture for easy money fixes it argues feed instability by creating global economic conditions that foster bubbles. As the story goes, demand side policies are band-aids slapped on top of deep structural wounds. This is especially the case in a world where financial intermediation dominates money channels with a vast array of levers, ropes, and pulleys that push the lag between easing and higher demand more and more unmeasurably into the future.</description>

      <description>US indicators out this week, like the Chicago PMI and the CPI estimates, support both sides of a US turn-around, the output side and the consumption side. Yet still the FED, though widely expected to raise rates in the summer, remains tight-lipped about it, downplaying positive economic indicators. This sounds like policy speak for &#39;we want to keep the option in our pocket,&#39; and there is good reason. While the UK and the US have been running the money tap seemingly forever, at least since 1929 part-two, the great depression strikes back, the rest of the known world, and the unknown world, is starting to catch up.</description>

      <description>Yesterday&#39;s flash Harmonized Consumer Price Index indicated a drop in EMU price rises to 0.5%. Given the ECB&#39;s primary target is price stability, markets are widely anticipating tomorrow&#39;s ECB meeting will see overnight interest rates reduced to negative levels.This would have banks less likely to deposit daily surpluses in the ECB overnight and more likely to loan them out. They would also commit a smaller portion of liquidity to paying down liabilities previously acquired with the ECB.</description>

      <description>Introduction The following article comprises my general world economic outlook. It is necessary to clarify a few points for the reader. Firstly, the exercise is positive rather than normative. For example, any mention of oil should be read as an inchoate view of where world oil prices, or supply and demand, may go in future periods, rather than a statement that policies should pursue increased oil output, or that carbon fuel consumption is net surplus enhancing.</description>

      <description>Abstract This report analyzes EU-wide public procurement markets and market segments through modelling of the EU&#39;s Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) data, among other sources, as well as the critical legal elements of the emerging EU-wide public procurement regime. The modelling results point to procurement markets that are particularly contestable for Canadian Companies. In the fast changing world of public procurement, the work in this paper is no longer relevant, but does provide sources for future research.</description>

      <description>Abstract This paper analyzes the effects of trade liberalization on productivity at the sector level. This is done with a multivariable regression of relative gross labour productivity on sector trade, between the U.S. and Canada, relative to total trade, between Canada and the world. A set of before and after treatment variables are used to distinguish the difference between the effect of trade openness before the NAFTA preferential trade agreement and after the agreement.</description>

      <description>Abstract This paper reviews arguments in academic literature for and against Lithuania&#39;s pursuit of EMU accession. The results indicate Lithuania stands to gain in trade with ROW and with the EMU on completion of change-over to the Euro. Moreover, trade specialization and the potential of under-trading, promise further gains from Euro accession. Economies of scale ensure that gains from trade and currency management cost reductions will be large relative to GDP.</description>

      <description>Abstract This paper reviews academic arguments for and against fiscal policy alignment and increased transnational budgets in the EMU. It suggests credit market instruments are costlier than tax based transfers and the current system of structural funding is inadequate,and an enhanced fiscal transfer system, funded from a community level tax base, is an optimal pathway toward business cycle convergence in the EMU.

Then the Conservatives released their economic update and political mayhem ensued. Stephane, Jack and Gille went up the hill and planned a coalition coupe. Stephan Harper set a frighteningly partisan political precedent by proroguing parliament when the conservatives were facing an election they looked likely to lose. And, after Mr.</description>

Former Premier Bill Vander Zalm grasped onto the issue like a life raft, presumably hoping to resurrect his long-thought dead but apparently still alive Social Credit initiatives. The NDP are joining Mr. Vander Zalm in the attack on the provincial Liberal for, perhaps, partisan reasons (it&#39;s worth nothing that New Democrats in prairies support the HST).</description>

      <description>What ever happened to Canadian government for all Canadians? Clearly out the window. Whatever happened to non-partisan politics? Has there ever been such a thing? Do we really need an economic stimulus package, or is the recent uproar in the House of Commons little more than partisan on partisan? Will a coalition government serve the people well? Is democracy being put to the test?
Well, it&#39;s not much, but technically an increase in newspaper sales should cause an increase in GDP, and if one opens the paper it&#39;s hard not to imagine an increase in newspaper sales.</description>

      <description>Okay, Obama is in the news, he&#39;s made friends, he&#39;s made headlines, he&#39;s made history-he&#39;s everywhere. The world stands in awe. Democracy has been authenticated. It&#39;s no longer a form of government that claims to champion the cause of the marginalized while craftily concealing the domination of the under-privileged by autocrats and oligarchs---it&#39;s the real the thing: true government by popular representation.
And it&#39;s clear that people view Obama as a human being--- someone with a conscience, who believes that America stands for democracy, liberty, freedom, and the rule of law.</description>

I&#39;d like to add the movements of populist governments to his irrational people bit as, it seems to me, both populist governments and stock markets are guided by public opinion. If public opinion is an expression of human behavior, (run that one by your local shrink if you like,) does that make it the result of feelings, instincts, and herd-like responses to media induced perceptions (not a herd of hippo&#39;s mind you, that&#39;s the U.</description>

Finally, economic and politically minded people everywhere are revisiting the decisions that have shaped our global economy into the fertile soil for crisis that it has become.
Milton Friedman&#39;s legacy is under attack. The concepts of nationalism and socialism in the state are not only being reconsidered, they are being re-instituted as we speak (the nationalization of big banks globally).</description>

The common sense approach says that to avoid a sudden crash or some kind of long drawn out debt deflation, the American Government needs to address the ability of the real economy to earn, borrow and spend. And in this sense yes, much of the relief could have gone to debtors at large and not the creditors, who to pay their new debts will have to lend more.</description>
