      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s All This About Text Editors? I always used to ask, why do people post about their text-editors? These days I know the reason. Computers are lightening fast, using them isn&#39;t. You need to leave what you are doing to turn on another piece of software. You have to search for files. You&#39;re constantly having to remember how a process works, or search around the IDE to figure out how to do something again.</description>

      <description>Staying Focused On Being Yourself 
Here is something to think about. What does it mean to be normal?  The picture below is a picture of a bean machine, also known as a Quincunx, a Dalton Board, or Plinko.  What happens to the ball when it gets dropped into the top of the bean machine? It gets bounced around right? Does the ball get to choose in which slot it will end up?</description>

      <description>About Cloud Nine  Cloud Nine is a blog about &amp;lsquo;stuff.&amp;rsquo; Yes, exactly, &amp;lsquo;stuff,&amp;rsquo; in all its ambiguous grandeur. &amp;lsquo;Stuff&amp;rsquo; can mean pretty much anything, but I&amp;rsquo;m talking about a special kind of stuff, that kind that makes us human. You know like, &amp;lsquo;aack,&amp;rsquo; philosophy, ethics, motivation, and work. Or, success, family, friends, and community. Okay, you get the point. I have a license to write about pretty much anything here.</description>
