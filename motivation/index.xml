      <description>Poppy, punky, alternative sounds you&#39;re probably already familiar with through their advertising business. They&#39;re not so far on Wiki yet, but below are descriptions from their webpage.&#34;Midnight Riot is the edgy duo brought to life by soulful rocker Emily Kopp, and guitarist/producer Justin Beckler. Drawing from their love of pop and old school indie rock, their creations feature good old-fashioned guitar riffs, room-shaking stomps and claps, and hooks that sink so deep you&#39;ll be humming them for weeks.</description>

      <description>Today I took the train around town and ran some errands. There&#39;s an apocalypse. There were a lot of unhappy people in thestreets. Rephrase that. Everyone in the street appeared unhappy. I understand. It&#39;s a pandemic.
One of my Facebook readers responded to my last post about Julian Assange. Why so serious? What&#39;s all this posting about war?
I understand. Doom and gloom subjects weigh our spirits down. A politician once told me you can&#39;t change the world, you can only squeeze it to get what you want out of it.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s motivational video is about the benefits of cognitive ambidexterity, why you should take some time to work on that each week, and how you can do that.
 For those of you that come here for my emacs posts, don&#39;t worry, nothing has changed. I have been working onmultidisciplinary studies for over twenty years. I routinely work at several types of activities. These include psychology work, finance,data science, computer programming, writing, and now also vlogging.</description>

      <title>Achieving Alignment Through Communication</title>

      <description>Psychologists do important work, but it doesn&#39;t take one to know that people operate a lot like computers. We&#39;ve got codeinside that issues a response when stimulated. The more you know the person, the more you know what responses to expect. In any organization teambuilding improves organizational outcomes. But what is going on when team members bond?
Alignment is a concept that explains what&#39;s going on. Let each line in this chart represent a person; but more than that, let itrepresent their psychology, the millions of associations their mind contains between images andexpectations, words and definitions, and information and responses.</description>

      <description>Habits can be bad, like when they deter progress toward your current set of goals, and they can begood, like when they move you closer to your goals or align you with them (if, for example, your goal is toattain a certain state of being).Habits include things like the way you spend your time, the way you think about things, and the way youcommunicate. They determine where you are going.</description>

The picture below is a picture of a bean machine,  also knownas a Quincunx,  a Dalton Board,  or Plinko. 
What happens to the ball when it gets dropped into the top of the bean machine? Itgets bounced around right? Does the ball get to choose in which slot it will end up?</description>

      <description>Numerous studies have examined what intangible and tangible factors might cause one organization to outperform othersover a period of time. There is no question that ideas and talent are invaluable, but it is no longer any surprise that the single mostimportant factor affecting organizational performance is organizational psychology. Here are a few examples:
Ray Dalio runs Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. In Connecticut, he&#39;s got 1500 people,some of whom are the best and brightest brains in the financial sector, but does Ray cite his PhDs, research acumen, and process as hisnumber one a comparative advantage?</description>

      <description>Inspiration is about being on the upswing. Find out what gets you there, find out what keeps you there, and make a habit of it. Success is about a good nights sleep, either tomorrow is Sunday or you are prepared to meet it. Self-improvement is a lifestyle. Expectations are so yesterday. Grey area is dangerous. Make sure you spell it out. Prodigality is tiresome. Habits are the measuring stick you are looking for.</description>
