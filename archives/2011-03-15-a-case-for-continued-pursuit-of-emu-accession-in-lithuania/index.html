        <h3>Abstract</h3>

<div class="blockquote">This paper reviews a variety of academic publications, including those from authors who produced gravity models, and presents trade
arguments for and against Lithuanian accession to the European Monetary Union (EMU). While the results prompt the author to argue in favour
of accession, there is no commentary on either the benefits of reduced default risk or the costs of potential negative externalities like
declines in living conditions or increased brain drain and population exodus that could result if accession causes tax increases, higher
unemployment or lowered government expenditure.</div>

<p class = "p-news">
Excessive budget deficits, changes in debt to GDP ratios, high unemployment and uncertainty about currency union longevity, across the EU,
are sure to have Lithuanian policy makers questioning any continued implementation of austere programs, or heightened pursuit of Maastricht
Criteria. An accurate forecast of gains to trade from Euro zone accession seems in order. The literature seeking to isolate a (Rose
effect,)(2) however, is a pointed reminder that, if such accuracies exist, they are highly case specific and ever elusive. Yet critiques
and examples of Rose effect applications are sources of country specific currency union particulars. This paper examines the case for
Lithuania (LT), through the (Rose lens,) as it were, and concludes that, any probability of EMU collapse aside, continued pursuit of
Euro zone admittance is in Lithuania's best interest.</p>

<p class = "p-news">The mishandling of the pass-through equation in Rose (2000) led to a severely upward omitted variable bias. Baldwin (2006) suggests
including a Relative-Prices-Matter (RPM)(3) term corrects for correlation between error and trade cost terms in gravity model regressions.
The need for a relative-terms-of-trade variable highlights the issue of trade diversion versus trade creation. Will joining the EMU raise
Lithuania's cost of trade with the Rest-Of-World (ROW)? Two parts to an answer include changes in export and import prices and economies of
scale in trade flows.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Export and import prices are frequently functions of exchange rates and tariff levels. Since 2002, the Litas has been pegged by currency
board to the Euro. Since the 2004 EU 5 expansion, Lithuania has applied external EU tariffs. Unless adopting the Euro raises export prices
significantly, trade volume fluctuations caused by exchange rate uncertainty would change little. Ercolani (2009) compares non-Euro country
inflation rates to Euro converting country inflation rates during conversion to the Euro. His results reveal France, Germany, Greece, Spain
and the Netherlands experienced inflation rate spikes during Euro conversion. Surti (2008) gives evidence that prices, in Slovenia, were
re-indexed upward by 0.05 to 0.1 percent, during Slovenia's change-over to the Euro. Both researchers report price increases were in
primarily non-tradable goods sectors. In the tradable sectors, it seems more likely the counter argument, a key point in Baldwin's
critique on Rose (2000), would apply: that reduced transaction costs cause re-equilibration in Cournot collusion settings, lowering tradable
sector prices(4).</p>

<p class = "p-news">Standard trade diversion theory sides with demand, implying increased intra-EMU demand for exports would see prices rise to ROW. Lithuanian
trade data, across 2004 to 2010, suggests this Euro change-over inflation(5) would be unlikely to affect trade flows. Across this time
period, trade-flows were remarkably consistent(6). A second argument, as we can see below, suggests Euro conversion actually inspires more
trade with ROW. A final argument, relevant to countries seeking accession with currencies not pegged to the Euro, suggests EMU challenges
are likely to lead to Euro devaluation, inspiring greater trade with ROW.</p>

<p class = "p-news">The second answer to the trade diversion question is a geographical certainty. Klaipeda is a point of entry and exit for no small amount of
goods. Melyantsou and Kazakevich (2006) quote Belorussian President Alexander Lukashenko, (30 percent of Lithuania's national budget
is formed thanks to shipment of our goods and cargos at their ports.) Though the associated footnote estimates this number in terms of
profit, at 0.5% of Lithuanian 2005 budget revenue, 30 percent of a national budget is still a significant amount of gross trade activity.
Adding Russia's and Poland's use of the port and the argument is that economies of scale in trade flows will keep trade costs with
Lithuania's major trading partners low(7).</p>

<p class = "p-news">When Baldwin (2006) suggests on Berger and Nitsch (2005) that they next incorporate estimations for bilateral pass-through-elasticities, as
proxies for pair-specific trade integrations, he is implying that more tightly integrated nations have higher pass-through ratios. In the
Lithuanian case, close integration with neighbours, all of whom constitute ROW relative to EMU, would reduce the Rose effect, as intra-EMU
trade costs would be reduced by less, relative to trade costs with major ROW trading partners.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Bilateral pass-through-inelasticities are only part of the east west integration story. Baldwin (2006) cites Flam and Nordstrom (2003) as
his favoured gravity model exercise. Flam and Nordstrom (2003) control for the RPM term, the time varying deflation of nominal trade values
and model miss-specifications (8). Surprisingly, they find a Rose effect that equals an EU effect, at approximately 8%. Also puzzling, they
find that non-EU nations exporting to EMU nations have the same Rose effect as intra-EMU trading nations. The conclusion is that the Euro
liberalizes trade unilaterally rather than preferentially, suggesting EMU countries are more attractive to non-EMU exporters. Across 2004 to
2010 more than 70% of Lithuania's imports came from non-EMU exporters. Two thirds of those consistently came from bordering countries,
with Russia exporting the lion's share. The intuition is that, rather than lowering trade to ROW, EMU accession could increase both ROW
and intra-EMU trade.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Flam and Nordstrom (2003)(9) also isolate Rose effects by sector. Their analysis concludes that Standard International Trade Classifications
(SITC) 1, 6 and 7 have the highest and most significant Rose effect coefficients(10). The largest coefficient is the SITC 1, food and
beverage, which seems typically overestimated at .352 (suggesting joining the Euro increases food and beverage trade by 142%). If converting
to the Euro were to increase tourism, which it may well do, especially if Latvia, Sweden and/or Poland also convert, this high number might
make more sense. Incidentally, Dalia Bernatonyte (2010) conducts a trade specialization exercise, combining a Balassa index (11) with a
relative import advantage index, in logarithmic form, to form a Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index. Her findings report that
Lithuania has RCA in trade with EU in: food, drink and tobacco, raw materials and other manufactured goods. These correspond to SITC 0,
1,2,4,6 and 8, implying an RCA in two of the three sectors that have the highest and most significant responses to gravity model currency
union trade gain predictions.</p>

<p class = "p-news">An additional gravity model application consists of comparing actual trade flows to predicted ones, with the intention of classifying
countries as under-traded or over-traded. Nwabuzor and Nwakanma (2007) apply this technique to new EU members across 2004 to 2007. They
employ (post Rose-Van Wincoop) techniques to account for various omitted variable biases and time and country varying effects. They
conclude Lithuania's actual exports to EU-15 were approximately 20% higher than predicted, on account of over-trading to the U.K. They
hypothesize Lithuania is (under-traded with the other new EU members thus creating potential for exports.) Though this hypothesis
supports an argument for continued pursuit of Maastricht Criteria (presuming EMU inclusion will increase trade with 5th enlargement
countries), it is still subject to Baldwin's (2006) critique of EU data.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Baldwin (2006) is suspicious of EU data collection inaccuracy. He associates this with (acquisition and carousel fraud) that allows
criminals to receive VAT export reimbursements without paying VAT rates on imports. VAT fraud creates a gap between export and import
statistics and can inflate trade statistics. If we suppose a correlation between high corruption countries and inflated statistics, we would
like to estimate corruption levels before considering the policy implications of Nwabuzor's and Nwakanma's (2007) hypothesis.</p>

<p class = "p-news">Raimundas Urbonas (2009) notes Lithuania scores 26th of 29 European nations on the Corruption Perceptions Index (TI CPI). By this index,
only Romania, Bulgaria and Poland have more corruption and even Italy is less corrupt. Corruption is high enough that simply converting to
the more liquid Euro could raise informal trade volumes. Corruption levels and over reporting of EU statistics suggest Lithuania may have
greater trade potential than measured by Nwabuzor and Nwakanma (2007).</p>

<p class = "p-news">A further critique in Baldwin (2006) suggests Rose (2000) erred when he took the log of the sums of trade flows and not the sum of the logs.
His point is that relative size of tradeflows matter. Small open economies gain more from currency unions than large closed ones. By GDP
2010, Lithuania is 1% the size of Germany, the EU's largest economy, by population 4% (12). The World Trade Organization records
Lithuania's 2007-2009 trade to GDP ratio at 121.7 (a measure of openness). By currency union trade gains relative to GDP, Lithuania
stands to gain more than any OECD country. The same economies-of-scale argument applies to actual money supply minting and maintenance (13).
Economy of scale gains from transferring money supply maintenance to the supranational level relative to the costs of the same will be
large.</p>

<p class = "p-news">The evidence in favour of continued pursuit of EMU entry is large. Yet counter arguments deserve some attention. Standard arguments against
currency union theory include lack of independent monetary policy, loss of exchange rate devaluation adjustment mechanisms and losses from
trade diversion. In the Lithuanian case, independent monetary policy has been given up in favour of a currency board arrangement. The same
arrangement sacrifices the exchange rate adjustment mechanism. The historical, cultural and geographic nature of roughly 50% of the
Lithuanian trade-flows, suggest the presence of pass-through inelasticities.</p>

<p class = "p-news">It follows the task is one of finding downsides rather than upsides. One potential downside, higher interest rates on debt, is more relevant
to the Poland case, where debt-to-GDP ratios are much higher (though it is still noteworthy). Other downsides include increased
corruption(14) and risk of EMU collapse. Both of these costs seem slight when compared to potential trade gains and transaction cost
savings.</p>

<p class = "p-news">In closing, Baldwin (2006) suggested trade economists, seeking Rose effects, ask the question of (how?) rather than (of how
much?) This paper has heeded his advice and examined the potential gains to Lithuania from EMU accession, using the gravity model debates
as a guideline. The results indicate Lithuania stands to gain in trade with ROW and with the EMU on completion of change-over to the Euro.
Moreover, trade specialization and the potential of under-trading, promise further gains from Euro accession. Economies of scale ensure that
gains from trade and currency management cost reductions will be large relative to GDP. However, corruption could impose ambiguity on Euro
accession trade gains. If replacing the Litas with the Euro increases corruption, the effects on FDI and tourism revenues could be negative.
On the other hand, an increase in corruption could entail an increase in the velocity of money and an associated increase in informal GDP.</p>

<p class = "p-news">The policy implications of (how) Euro accession will affect Lithuania are clear: continued pursuit of Maastricht Criteria is in order.
Ramunas Vilpisauskas (2010)(15), notes that all the three of the Baltic countries reduced budget expenditures and increased taxes at the
beginning of the 2008 downturn. He also points out, across 2008 to 2010, wages declined by 8.7%. Statistics LT reports a debt to GDP ratio,
at 2010 year end, of 38%, little more than half of the EU average. On the other hand, in 2009, of EU members, only Romania had a higher
inflation rate (Lithuania's averaged 4.2%)(16). Also, Lithuania's 2010 18.3% unemployment rate tied Latvia's for the second highest
unemployment in the EU (next to Spain's). Even its relatively reasonable 2009 9% budget deficit was 3 times larger than Germany's. This
paper provides significant evidence that continued pursuit of EMU entry is in Lithuania's best interest, but such pursuit will need to
continue for some years before admittance to the EMU is assured.</p>
