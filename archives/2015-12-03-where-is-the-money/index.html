        <div class="mt-4 mb-4 main-content">
        <p class= "p-news">As Krugman might say, "...it's in the market, stupid." The most influential economy in the world is poised to raise
<b><i>interest rates</i></b>, but not because of <b><i>inflation</i></b>. Central banks in major parts of the world are still at the zero bound, and core prices are
behaving as they should when targeted only because liquidity is trapped on balance sheets as inventory. What happened? Why did monetary
easing take half a decade to jump-start the US dollar economy? The answers are common knowledge: banks bought banks with the money, main
street lending didn't increase, dealers expanded balance sheets, corporate savings stayed high, investment stayed low; and only now, six
years later, is money supply warming up wages and consumption, if it isn't <b><i>fiscal expenditure</i></b>.</p>

<p class= "p-news">Economists have been discussing causality (or lack thereof) between money supply and prices for the entire last century
(see here in the context of viable central bank tools); but, theoretically, the accounting identity <b><i>MV = PY</i></b> is supposed to remain valid in
the long-run--more dollars chasing the same goods push prices up. And this is exactly why central bankers should be worried, and interest
rates could have gone up earlier. Today the relationship between money supply and output is like nothing it has ever been. By traditional
measures, money velocity relative trend has all but stopped. To visualize this recall the chart from Friedman's 2004 article, "The Fed's
Thermostat" (now you have to sign-in to read it, so see both of his charts below). His somewhat concessionary admonition, that central
bankers since the late 80's had done a better job by targeting inflation, was contingent on a trend-bound <b><i>money velocity</i></b> indicator.</p>

<p class= "p-news">Here is a remake of the same chart using current data (a remake of his other chart is also available below).</p>

<p><img src="/images/archives/inflation.png" alt="Money Deceleration" align="center" title="Graphic Author: Yuri Tricys" class="img center" width="80%"/>
<small class="col-4 d-flex mx-auto ">Graphic Author: Yuri Tricys</small></p>

<p class= "p-news">In his chart, the final segment of the trend line is extrapolated, but the point is clear: not only is money velocity
still moving in the wrong direction, it's also frighteningly far from trend. The <b><i>inflation overhang</i></b> in the US is so abnormally gigantic it
shouts, <b><i>"outlier."</i></b> The chart prompts at least two questions: 1) how will money velocity get back to trend?, and 2) does it have to? Answers
to the first question are the point of this post--proceed with caution. Answers to the second are the can-opening caveats.</p>

<p class= "p-news">Proceed with caution because prices are more <b><i>elastic</i></b> than output and money supply is arguably less complicated to
increase than decrease. In other words, inflation overhang means expect inflation. In the case where <b><i>external money demand</i></b> is low, a little
inflation is good but too much is a bad thing (see Brazil, for a tame example). Where external money demand is high, as in the US where it
is the highest by volume in the world, too much inflation, aside from the usual malaise, could undermine hegemonic authority and increase
political friction.</p>

<p class= "p-news">In answer to the second question, inference would be a lot easier if dependent variables were driven by trend, but
everybody knows <b><i>reversion to the mean</i></b> is at least somewhat probable. What I'm really getting at is the definition of money velocity itself.
Nominal markets, like financial ones, and real markets, like goods markets, are linked through <b><i>reflexivity</i></b>, the most prominent example given
in the relationships between <b><i>mark-to-market</i></b> accounting, corporate health, and unemployment; but, in terms of a decent thermostat, it's the
supply of money in real markets that should be compared to output, and a lot of M2 if not legally is at least by expectation anchored to
financial markets. The inflation overhang might not be as bad as it looks because it might not be as large as it looks; there is money in
the trap that may never come out. And all this leads to seemingly unanswerable questions, like, for example, how big can the ratio of <b><i>global
financial market capitalization</i></b> to capital base get?</p>

<p class= "p-news">One problem when thinking along this line is that, with respect to balance sheets and <b><i>instantaneous transactions</i></b>, as a
globe, we've outgrown any situation known before. It's no longer possible to sum <b><i>ex-post</i></b> our worldly experience and prognosticate money
growth effects with any assurance <b><i>ex-anti</i></b>. Global capital base continues to grow, not only through the effects of population growth, but
also the realization of Hernando De Soto's suggested developing economy fix (the formalization of undocumented property rights). No-one
knows. The effects of credit over-expansion, though more identifiable (and tangible) than the those from wealth expansion, are also
abstruse, as any and every asset bubble chaser will surely attest. How much credit is too much credit? Sure, <b><i>this time is different,</i></b> but
what about Japan?</p>

<p class= "p-news">The point really is that it's time to think about that money in the trap. 2008 would have been a better time, but it's
2015, US equity markets are sitting on a the tail of a 15 year rather volatile bull, and the <b><i>FED</i></b> is about to raise interest rates. There are
bigger than ever amounts of money swashing around in mammoth unstable capacitor-like markets and no way to predict where those flows are
going to go. International <b><i>interest rate spreads</i></b> could lead to massive bi-lateral capital flows, contagion could spread like wildfire, <b><i>hot
money</i></b> could cool rapidly through investment and push prices up. The latter case, an increase in investment, better if funded through
<b><i>retained corporate earnings,</i></b> was hoped for--no, anticipated--after easing, but gradually, not all at once. America is sitting on volatile
over-inflated markets, it's cold outside, the temperature inside still isn't rising, and it's time to take another look at the
thermostat.</p>

<p class= "p-news">Time-series GDP deflator and money velocity, from Friedman's 2004 article, "The Fed's Thermostat." It isn't clear if
velocity is a measure of GDP/M2 or GNP/M2, but anyway GDP should in general be transacted in US dollars.</p>
