        <div class="mt-4 mb-4 main-content">
        <p class = "p-news"> <img src="/images/current/hillary.jpg" alt="" align="right" title="" class="img ml-4 mb-4" width="60%" />Forgive me for pointing
out the obvious, which you surely already know, but I see no harm in expanding on the Assange trial and hope you will at least thank me for not posting
yet another picture of toilet paper.</p>

<p class = "p-news">First, note the image to the right says "Journalism is not a Crime." It does not say "Do not extradite Julian Assange." I'd
like more information, but I'm not in a position to pick sides. This is a legal issue and I'm not an informed juror. Nevertheless, key
elements of what we can call the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract" target="_blank">Social Contract</a>" are under
dispute and future international legal precedence is in formation.</p>

<p class = "p-news">There are questions on the table. The following are among them. Can the law be bought? Should war be refereed?</p>

<p class = "p-news">Allow me to explain. In a perfect society, the judicial arm would be omniscient, ruthlessly fair, and equally accessible
to all. No lawyer will like this statement, but all lawyers would be fungible. Any given lawyer would be exactly as effective as the next
and all information would be known to all parties (yes, obviously if the judicial system were omniscient there would be no need for lawyers).

<p class= "p-news">In reality, nothing is perfect, but principles exist. Number one, judges should be immune to bribery and intimidation. Number two, no party
should be above the law. These principles are in theory at the foundation of advanced societies. Picture a sporting event. The blue team
wants to win and will contest every call the referee makes that does not go their way. The red team will do the same. Both teams will draw
on all the resources they have available to win. To ensure a fair field, the league will put salary caps in place and provide the best
obtainable refereeing. Everyone knows when the league changes the rules the team with the best shooters will lobby for the smallest net (or
perhaps not, but anyway they will use their power to optimize their likelihood of victory). Everyone agrees it's better for the game if no
team can change the rules so they can win. </p>

<p class= "p-news">War is not a game. It's the most serious, dangerous, and catastrophic man-made event in the human
world, but there rules. Yes, the Geneva conventions are sparse and rarely followed, but they are rules nonetheless.</p>

<h5>Journalism is The Referee</h5>

<p class = "p-news">Journalism is the only way to enforce the rules. The stakes are the highest stakes in the world. Naturally, the sides
need or want to win more than to follow the rules. In countless cases, they cannot even hope to control their forces. Instead, the seek to
control what the world sees. They block journalists. They remove their film. They smash their cameras. They intimidate them. They kill them.
Refereeing warfare is a dangerous job. </p>

<p class = "p-news"><a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank">Wikileaks</a> goes the extra mile. They take everything they can get by
any means they can get it and publish whatever they can. Their mandate is to ensure there is a referee. Everything that goes on in the field
of war should be visible to everyone in the world. </p>

<p class = "p-news">War is a public event and the public should get to see it and respond to what the most powerful organizations in the
world do to the rest of us. </p>

<p class = "p-news">But it's a complicated event. Combatants do anything and everything to win. They use the rules to their advantage. They
weaponize innocent people. </p>

<p class = "p-news">Governments don't want journalists stealing and publishing their internal communications. How will the journalists
decide what to publish? Are they immune to influence? Combatants have the highest need for secrecy. Do journalists get to decide who lives
and dies? What happens when referees handle the ball?</p>

<p class = "p-news">What's happening now is that the most powerful side in human history is doing everything it can, constrained only by
journalism and law, to hang the guy that exposed its information. </p>

<p class = "p-news">He took it illegally, they say. He's a spy, playing sides. Millions on millions of dollars have been spent to destroy
this guy. They want to make sure no-one ever again messes with their information without paying the highest price. </p>

<p class = "p-news">They have relatively an infinite budget to achieve their objective. There is no hope for fairness. To what lengths have
they gone to achieve their ends? Did they cheat? Did they break the rules? Are they above the law?</p>

<p class = "p-news">The sides argue Assange exposed covert operations. Assange argues no-one was exposed. The overall result, which could
have been expected, was that forces were caught on camera joyfully murdering innocent civilians and laughing about it, among countless other
things. </p>

<p class = "p-news">In other circumstances those innocent people could be you and your family. Governments are pressed under only such
circumstances to be more responsible killers. Without journalism there is no hope for progressive rules of engagement. </p>

<p class = "p-news">Is Julian Assange a hero for risking everything to achieve this result? Or is he a criminal to be handed over to one
side to do with as they would like?</p>

<p class = "p-news"><img src="/images/current/assange-trial.jpg" alt="" align="left" title="" class="img mr-4 mb-6" width="61%" />What are
the rules? Is the legal system fair? How will the future of journalism in international conflict be handled? Can a government do anything
they want to achieve an outcome? Can they falsify reality? Can they trump up false charges and accusations? What can a government do to the
referees? And what can journalists do to ensure the world gets to see what happens in international conflict?</p>

<p class = "p-news">The Julian Assange trial is important to you because it will define the future rights of journalists in international
conflict as well as the extent to which governments can legally use their powers to achieve their objectives. </p>

<p class = "p-news">While this may not be relevant to you now, it is relevant to the future of humanity, and especially relevant to those
99% of the people on the planet who will not wield military strength.</p>

<p class = "p-news">[images: 1) Hillary Clinton sweating over the Benghazi emails. To Democrats, who are the bulk of my readers, this should
emphasize the complexity of Assange trials 2) Julian Assange and his defence walking outside of court.]</p>

<p class = "p-news">Give me time to recommend an unbiased summary of the unfolding proceedings, or post one below. </p>
