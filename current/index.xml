      <description>Nothing, but it could have been worse. Actually, I got bored and didn&#39;t watch it all. I&#39;m writing about it here because there were a couple of things I liked, and I will tell about those shortly.
First, disclaimer: I didn&#39;t watch any of the Cloverfield series. They must have been good though, because the films made a lot of money. The box office from the first one, &#34;Cloverfield,&#34; released in 2008, something like tripled cost.</description>

      <description>Forgive me for pointing out the obvious, which you surely already know, but I see no harm in expanding on the Assange trial and hope you will at least thank me for not posting yet another picture of toilet paper.
First, note the image to the right says &#34;Journalism is not a Crime.&#34; It does not say &#34;Do not extradite Julian Assange.&#34; I&#39;d like more information, but I&#39;m not in a position to pick sides.</description>
