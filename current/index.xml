Can you think of any other way you would rather spend your afternoon?
Probably not.

Actually, I got bored and
didn't watch it all. I'm writing about it here because there were a couple of things I liked. I'll tell you about those shortly.
First, disclaimer: I didn't watch any of the Cloverfield series. They must have been good though, because they made a lot of money. The box office from the first one, "Cloverfield," released in 2008, something like tripled cost.</description></item><item><title>Why The Julian Assange Trial is Important to You</title><link>https://cloudnine.github.io/current/2020-03-17-relevence-of-julian-assange/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnine.github.io/current/2020-03-17-relevence-of-julian-assange/</guid><description>Forgive me for pointing
out the obvious, which you surely already know, but I see no harm in expanding on the Assange trial and hope you will at least thank me for not posting
yet another picture of toilet paper.
First, note the image to the right says "Journalism is not a Crime." It does not say "Do not extradite Julian Assange." I'd
like more information, but I'm not in a position to pick sides.</description></item></channel></rss>
