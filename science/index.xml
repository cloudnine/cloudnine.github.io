      <description>Below are some notes covering among other things why I got into Emacs, where I got my version, and how my configuration isorganized. As mentioned before, other text editors in use today, like Atom, IntelliJ Idea, or SublimeText are awesome, and offer also great selections of unique packages. Atom, for example, has some super useful snippet packages. You canconvert them into Yasnippet format (an Emacs snippet package), but it&#39;s a hassle.</description>

      <description>Jumping To Directories In EmacsIf you want to accomplish things efficiently with your computer, you will benefit from mastering a text editor. I use emacs as a generalproject manager for web development, writing, and organizing thoughts, materials, and actions. Jumping to and from directories and filesenables quickly me to get things done more efficiently. To do this I use a few different packages and functions.They are:  Bookmarks</description>

      <description>What&#39;s All This About Text Editors?I always used to ask, why do people post about their text-editors? These days I know the reason. Computers are lightening fast, using themisn&#39;t. You need to leave what you are doing to turn on another piece of software. You have to search for files. You&#39;re constantly having toremember how a process works, or search around the IDE to figure out how to do something again.</description>
