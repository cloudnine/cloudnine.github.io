      <description>Emacs Tutorial, Exporting Org-Mode Files To PDF, Episode 1
  The above video demonstrates inserting text and images into an org-mode file. I use a function in emacs initialization topull images from a specified directory into org-mode files. See below. The first function, &#34;get-newest-file-from-dir&#34; is used in the secondfunction, &#34;insert-org-image&#34;. It&#39;s the second function I&#39;m calling from a hydra when I pull images from the downloads directory. With alittle more code you can easily combine downloading and pulling images into org-files, in fact the emacs package easy-hugo has a download,process, and insert image into your blog (markdown or org file) function baked into it.</description>

      <description>A brief introduction to Wget, Curl, and Headless Chrome.
  Wget and Curl and small programs easily installed through your package manager, or directly by downloading andinstalling. Headless Chrome can be installed from the command line using node and node&#39;s package manager npm. Install node globally and addadd it to your path (or use your package manager to install it). Ensure npm is installed. Headless Chrome can be used globally or in a localworking directory via a package.</description>

      <description>Updated March 18, 2021Most of my code has changed a lot recently. Check updated posts.
For each post can update code listed in that post.Keep in mind code for linux and wsl configs will have their own posts,except in the case of .early-init and init.el, which have systemswitches (to load system specific dot-files).
Also note: abandoned convention of listing initlines. Now if you want to find the code, and there is now plentyof decent emacs code, use the search function.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s post jumps ahead to the shell hydra Emacs is old school. You&#39;re either new to it - which means you wouldn&#39;t be here unless it was your type of thing - or youknow what you&#39;re looking for. In either case, go to the side bar of this page and click on the &#39;Emacs&#39; tag. Then read the posts fromoldest to newest.
In the last emacs post I coveredlines 534 - 656 of my configuration file.</description>

      <description>Updated March 18, 2021Most of my code has changed a lot recently. Check updated posts.
For each post can update code listed in that post.Keep in mind code for linux and wsl configs will have their own posts,except in the case of .early-init and init.el, which have systemswitches (to load system specific dot-files).
Also note: abandoned convention of listing initlines. Now if you want to find the code, and there is now plentyof decent emacs code, use the search function.</description>

      <description>Updated March 18, 2021Loading EmacsEmacs users write custom code for their software. Each &#39;configuration&#39; can be highly individualized. Because some custom configurations take longer to load than others, Emacs users like to minimize and measure their &#39;load&#39; time.
The software loads like any other software, loading libraries included in the core, and then additional libraries according to various configuration files. With Emacs, these files are stored in various locations based on the settings specified by the user, and the system Emacs is installed on.</description>
