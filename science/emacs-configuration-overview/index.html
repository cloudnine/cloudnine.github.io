<h3>Intro Post So I Can Share Code Chunks From My Emacs Initialization File In Order</h3></p>

<p><p style= "text-align:justify;"> Here are some notes about how I set-up my emacs config, how I used to set it up, and what areas I&rsquo;m still
working on. As mentioned before, other text editors in use today, like Atom, IntelliJ Idea, or WebStorm are awesome, and offer also cool
unique packages. For example, Atom has some super useful snippet packages. Yes, you can convert them into Yasnippet&rsquo;s format (Yasnippet is
an emacs snippet package), but that&rsquo;s a hassle. Still, I use and promote emacs, despite the fact it&rsquo;s written in the incredibly widely used
elisp language, because it has an incredibly clean feel when you&rsquo;re using it. Properly configured, it&rsquo;s simple unencumbered text with all
the function of an IDE and much much more. Plus&hellip;it&rsquo;s old sKool, with a capital K.</p>
<br/></p>

<h3>Why </h3>

<p><p style= "text-align:justify;"> I first got into Emacs in 2013. After five or six years of part-time college in sciences and arts and many
years in industry in a variety of positions, including business owner, I went back to university in 2009 to finish my bachelors degree.
Having finished Adam Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Wealth Of Nations,&rdquo; but stumbled on Keynes&rsquo;s &ldquo;The General Theory of Employment, Interest And Money&rdquo; I
majored in economics. As much as the theory at what is now the Vancouver School of Economics was excellent, on the data and programming side
our courses disappointingly veered away from computer science. We were taught Stata. I used at one point Notepad++, and in one class we were
introduced to the R GUI, but I did most of my work with Excel, Word, and Open Office.
</p>
<p style= "text-align:justify;"> After graduation, I left the Economics Department. My passion for economics was (and is) still
alive, but for all it&rsquo;s beauty a university is an ugly thing. Nothing had changed. If the earth were to be &lsquo;flat&rsquo; today, the university would
promote it. The irony is that in our world both progress and degeneration are born from a profit making sham. I went on my way, but one year
after graduation a former professor contacted me and offered research work. Hungry for among other things knowledge I ended up back in the
jaws of the beast.
</p>
<br/>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
After signing the contract I spent a month wading through the theory. Elusively shallow waters turned deep. I needed guidance. For better
and worse, that&rsquo;s what I got. My director agreed to a budget for supervision. I had been digging around general equilibrium papers and had
found a lot of stuff written by <a href="https://aae.wisc.edu/faculty/tfrutherford/" target="_blank">Thomas Rutherford,</a> a Phd from
Stanford who in the late 90&rsquo;s had a lot of involvement with General Equilibrium Modelling Software (GAMS), one of the frameworks used to
solve equilibrium models. I found <a href="https://enec.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=169504" target="_blank">Renger Van
Nieuwkoop&rsquo;s</a> name while reading Rutherford&rsquo;s work, and when I saw it again beneath a GAMS thread post, I contacted him. Renger&rsquo;s price
was out of my range, but I guess the director anyway wanted to make it happen, because they spoke and I had my supervisor.
</p>
<br/>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
Renger gave me what I was looking for, the computational side of economics. He showed me <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"
target="_blank">Emacs</a> (the subject of this post), <a
href="https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/tree/2812b85880807e5da35dbf2e69fc1b577f2ad7f4" target="_blank">ESS</a> (the emacs speaks statistics
package, an interface alternative to the R GUI, or Rstudio), and the Emacs <a href="https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/gams-mode/tree/210bd355dd2075bde3fd76c880aa489a25a54cb5"
target="_blank">GAMS package</a>, now available on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/" target="_blank">Melpa</a>.
Most of our work focused on GAMS, but to do it I had to get started with Emacs. In the process, I dropped everything I&rsquo;d learned about Stata
and narrowed down on R. On the data side &ndash; GAMS models are fed panels of data called Social Accounting Matrices (SAMS), and a part of my job was
to build a big one &ndash; I was using Excel and Microsoft Access. Today of course I would still use a fair amount of Excel, but I would use a MySQL
program like Mariadb over Microsoft Access and I&rsquo;d use it through Emacs.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Where </h3>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
I never did meet Renger, but even over Skype, and even bouncing questions back at me as a questions, he was great to work with. That said,
he didn&rsquo;t need a lot of Emacs in his work flow. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like today, but back then his initialization file wasn&rsquo;t a big deal.
Even so, it was recommend I use a pre-configured Emacs installation. I used Vincent Goulet&rsquo;s <a
href="https://vigou3.gitlab.io/emacs-modified-windows/" target="_blank">version</a>, which then and at least for now comes with R and a
Latex engine pre-configured. It&rsquo;s not the one I&rsquo;m using now. I&rsquo;ll get to that.
</p>
<br/>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
The evolution of every Emacs configuration is too long of a story. It&rsquo;s a trial and error process. Emacs at it&rsquo;s best is like an operating
system in an operating system. You&rsquo;re building a car (well, a workshop) from second hand parts. You&rsquo;ve got to find them, fit and run them
together, fix them when they don&rsquo;t work, and make new ones when you need them. Everything is built in a variation of lisp called elisp, and
while lisp is a very cool language with a very cool history, it&rsquo;s basically useless for anything practical other than programming theory or
Emacs. You can get from a blank initialization to a fully operational emacs installation without taking a single lisp course, but if I were
to start again, I&rsquo;d take a week or two and do a crash course in Lisp. I&rsquo;m not an expert programmer, heck I&rsquo;ve only been programming seven
years, I&rsquo;m only just a jack of all trades, but I know enough to know a good resource when I see it. Here&rsquo;s a link to a book written by the
quite famous programmer, writer, and investor Paul Graham, founder of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Ycombinator</a>
one the incubators behind such startups as &ldquo;Dropbox,&rdquo; &ldquo;Airbnb,&rdquo; &ldquo;Zapier,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gitlab,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Docker,&rdquo; to name a few. You can buy Paul Graham&rsquo;s
book &ldquo;On Lisp, Advanced Techniques for Common Lisp&rdquo; from Amazon for $154 USD, or you can download essentially the same thing from Paul&rsquo;s
website <a href="https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf?t=1564708198&" target="_blank">here</a> for free. Either way, the book is
a decent introduction to programming and for anyone taking the emacs route in the long run worth, along with other resources, a few weeks of
your time.
</p>
<br/>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
Emacs configurations get hefty and drag on load time. You can run it as a server, in which case it runs as process and it&rsquo;s always on, or
you can optimize the load time. One way to do that is to use a Linux distro, and if you do you will find emacs is just all around faster.
There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons for this, one of them is that emacs packages are often written for Unix and spawn a lot of processes, which is slow
on the Windows NTFS backed file system. If you&rsquo;re just starting out, start on Linux. I&rsquo;m Windows user and it&rsquo;s not now worth it for me to
explore too much Linux. Having said that, since Windows SubSystem Linux came out, I&rsquo;m using Ubuntu on my windows machine, but I haven&rsquo;t
bothered to get X server up and running, or experimented with Virtual Box, two ways to really speed up Emacs on Windows. Actually, with my
config Emacs is not that slow. I mean yes, my startup time is more than 30 seconds not less than 3, but I could actually bring that down to
less than 10 seconds using conditional calls to code chunks in my babel tangles, which I am getting around to. Anyway, if you&rsquo;re going to
use emacs on windows without any Linux distro, you&rsquo;ll want to use a version that is compiled for windows. The advantage is you get access to
Linux libraries without having to use Cygwin (or as mentioned VirtualBox). You can compile Emacs for Windows
yourself or use someone elses compilation. Vincent Goulet&rsquo;s version is compiled for windows, I&rsquo;m using today a version I found on the web
last year that supports PDF Tools and Image Magick. Way Cool.
</p>
<br/>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
Here&rsquo;s the write up from my notes written for me so I know where I got my emacs version. I know nothing about the guy, I just use his distro.
</p>
<br/>
<h4> Windows Emacs Installation</h4>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
- a better emacs exe is compiled with imagemagick support, pdftools support, and other libraries sourced from
Mingw64. &ldquo;XPM JPEG TIFF GIF PNG RSVG IMAGEMAGICK SOUND NOTIFY ACL GNUTLS LIBXML2 ZLIB TOOLKIT_SCROLL_BARS MODULES THREADS LCMS2&rdquo;
Currently there is at least one person compiling and publishing a version with these patches, see here:

<p><h3>What</h3>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
An Emacs initialization file calls and configures packages (libraries). Like any other program resources need to be loaded into namespaces in order so
they can be found when called on. One of the more popular Emacs packages is called Org-mode. I think &ldquo;Org&rdquo; is for &ldquo;organization&rdquo; but I think
of &ldquo;Origami&rdquo; because org mode has cool section folding. Org-mode has an affiliated library called Org-babel. It enables labelled section chunks to be
sent to the interpreter or compiler. With Org-babel you can put your entire initialization file into one .org file (though it&rsquo;s actually not
recommended, but we&rsquo;ll get to that when/if I get more time.) You can then fold it to navigate it, and interpret it. Actually, you can
compile it into an elisp file for faster loading later.
</p>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
The following code sets up my initialization file. Ask any questions in the comments.

<h4>My Initialization File</h4>
<p style= "text-align:justify;">
Is a big one. Here&rsquo;s an image of it folded origami style. In later posts, I plan to go through quickly each of the sections. This can be a
reference to the order of those sections. Keep in mind, the more separate chunks you have to tangle, the slower your emacs installation will
load. Ideally you would have two versions of your init file, one with a ton of organized code chunks or folding and editing easily, and
another with one code chunk for optimal load time. You would also defer load times as much as possible with &ldquo;use-package&rdquo; or something like,
<code>(eval-after-load &lsquo;example-mode &lsquo;(require &lsquo;setup-example-mode))</code>
