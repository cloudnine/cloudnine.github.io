      <description>What is maths programming?Mathematical programming, or computational programming, is the process of translating mathematically representableproblems into computer languages then harnessing the power of computers to solve them. Along with the Internet, and task facilitation,mathematical programming is probably the most important contribution from the modern computer to human evolution. There are many kinds ofmathematical programming techniques. Among these are: linear and non-linear programming, integer programming, mixed complementary problems,networks, goal programming, multiple objective optimization, queuing theory, regression analysis, and many more.</description>

      <description>What is optimizationOptimization is about making choices that lead to first best outcomes. Mathematically,optimization is usually described with differential calculus, though when functions are linear, and problems are adequately fit substitutioncan lead to optimal solutions. In mathematics, optimization first requires the delineation of an objective function, a dependent functionmeant to be maximized or minimized through variations in the independent functions that predict it. Solving optimization problems thereforerequires identifying maximum or minimum points on the objective function and qualifying those points as local or global maximums orminimums.</description>
