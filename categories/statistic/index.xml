      <description>Abstract This paper reviews a variety of academic publications, including those from authors who produced gravity models, and presents trade arguments for and against Lithuanian accession to the European Monetary Union (EMU). While the results prompt the author to argue in favour of accession, there is no commentary on either the benefits of reduced default risk or the costs of potential negative externalities like declines in living conditions or increased brain drain and population exodus that could result if accession causes tax increases, higher unemployment or lowered government expenditure.</description>
