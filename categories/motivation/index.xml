      <description>Psychologists do important work, but it doesn&#39;t take one to know that people operate a lot like computers. We&#39;ve got code inside that issues a response when stimulated. The more you know the person, the more you know what responses to expect. In any organization team building improves organizational outcomes. But what is going on when team members bond?
Alignment is a concept that explains what&#39;s going on. Let each line in this chart represent a person; but more than that, let it represent their psychology, the millions of associations their mind contains between images and expectations, words and definitions, and information and responses.</description>

      <description>Habits can be bad, like when they deter progress toward your current set of goals, and they can be good, like when they move you closer to your goals or align you with them (if, for example, your goal is to attain a certain state of being). Habits include things like the way you spend your time, the way you think about things, and the way you communicate. They determine where you are going.</description>

      <description>Staying Focused On Being Yourself Here is something to think about. What does it mean to be normal?
The picture below is a picture of a **bean machine,** also known as a **Quincunx,** a **Dalton Board,** or **Plinko.**
What happens to the ball when it gets dropped into the top of the bean machine? It gets bounced around right? Does the ball get to choose in which slot it will end up?</description>

      <description>It is honorable to respect all peoples, given they are not acting outside the social contract, nor seeking to usurp unjustly another&#39;s rights or freedoms.
The law protects people in societies and enables societies to function. To the extent it remains to do so, it should be upheld at every turn. When there are laws that do not serve all citizens in a society equally, those laws should be challenged and amended.</description>

      <description>Numerous studies have examined what intangible and tangible factors might cause one organization to outperform others over a period of time. There is no question that ideas and talent are invaluable, but it is no longer any surprise that the single most important factor affecting organizational performance is organizational psychology. Here are a few examples:
Ray Dalio runs Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. In Connecticut, he&#39;s got 1500 people, some of whom are the best and brightest brains in the financial sector, but does Ray cite his PhDs, research acumen, and process as his number one a comparative advantage?</description>

      <title>Progress: Getting Along In Life</title>

      <description>Inspiration is about being on the upswing. Find out what gets you there, find out what keeps you there, and make a habit of it. Success is about a good nights sleep, either tomorrow is Sunday or you are prepared to meet it. Self-improvement is a lifestyle. Expectations are so yesterday. Grey area is dangerous. Make sure you spell it out. Prodigality is tiresome. Habits are the measuring stick you are looking for.</description>
