      <description>Emacs Tutorial, Exporting Org-Mode Files To PDF, Episode 1
  The above video demonstrates inserting text and images into an org-mode file. I use a function in emacs initialization topull images from a specified directory into org-mode files. See below. The first function, &#34;get-newest-file-from-dir&#34; is used in the secondfunction, &#34;insert-org-image&#34;. It&#39;s the second function I&#39;m calling from a hydra when I pull images from the downloads directory. With alittle more code you can easily combine downloading and pulling images into org-files, in fact the emacs package easy-hugo has a download,process, and insert image into your blog (markdown or org file) function baked into it.</description>

      <description>A brief introduction to Wget, Curl, and Headless Chrome.
  Wget and Curl and small programs easily installed through your package manager, or directly by downloading andinstalling. Headless Chrome can be installed from the command line using node and node&#39;s package manager npm. Install node globally and addadd it to your path (or use your package manager to install it). Ensure npm is installed. Headless Chrome can be used globally or in a localworking directory via a package.</description>

      <description>Updated March 18, 2021Most of my code has changed a lot recently. Check updated posts.
For each post can update code listed in that post.Keep in mind code for linux and wsl configs will have their own posts,except in the case of .early-init and init.el, which have systemswitches (to load system specific dot-files).
Also note: abandoned convention of listing initlines. Now if you want to find the code, and there is now plentyof decent emacs code, use the search function.</description>

For each post can update code listed in that post.Keep in mind code for linux and wsl configs will have their own posts,except in the case of .early-init and init.el, which have systemswitches (to load system specific dot-files).
Also note: abandoned convention of listing initlines. Now if you want to find the code, and there is now plentyof decent emacs code, use the search function.</description>

      <description>Updated March 18, 2021Loading EmacsEmacs users write custom code for their software. Each &#39;configuration&#39; can be highly individualized. Because some custom configurations take longer to load than others, Emacs users like to minimize and measure their &#39;load&#39; time.
The software loads like any other software, loading libraries included in the core, and then additional libraries according to various configuration files. With Emacs, these files are stored in various locations based on the settings specified by the user, and the system Emacs is installed on.</description>

      <description>The communications revolution is no longer promising to shift production possibility frontiers outwardly, it is doing sorapidly. But there is a second shift we have not seen yet, and that&#39;s the big data shift. The capacity for organizations to improvedecisions by rendering the changing digital footprint into meaningful direction, is going to reduce economic distortions in a number ofways. Firms will be able to match customers with products more efficiently.</description>

      <description>The data revolution is impacting government in a number of ways. The foremost is known as &#39;smart government&#39;, which is areference to the way governments manage the data they have and the way they make that management and the services that go with it availableto their clients (constituents in a democracy). The second impact, also intelligent, is known as the &#39;smart city.&#39;
Smart government is a concept championed by the Estonian government (our example), which won the United Nations PublicService Award, in the category of Promoting Whole of Government Approaches in the Information Age, for their online business registry.</description>

      <description>Enhanced financial regulation typically comes with intended and unintended consequences. Directive 2004/39/EC, the Marketfor Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), for example, successfully increased competition among financial instrument tradingorganizations in Europe. This brought down consumer prices and narrowed margins. It also sent market participants looking to move largeblocks of shares into dark pools, where trade data are not made public.
There will be intended and unintended consequences from MiFID&#39;s successor, MiFID2, which is anticipated to be in effectby January 2018.</description>

      <description>Information technologies and the data they create are changing the world rapidly in a multitude of ways. The legalprofession, one of the most traditional and adverse to change, is beginning to adapt. A new breed of data savvy lawyers are entering legalcircles everywhere and bringing with them an inertia from new technologies.
Firstly, the legal profession stands to gain from those data driven insights that are common across organizations, likemore accurately targeted marketing, more informed case selection, more efficient internal procedures, and pricing models that minimize bothlosses of producer surplus, and dead-weight losses.</description>

      <description>The Internet of things (IOT) is a reference to computerization in devices and machines we use in everyday life. Smarthomes and the smart appliances in them are examples of things that are more and more frequently connected to the Internet and programmablewith computers. Online appliances transmit sensory information upstream to computer processors that make decisions, like adjusting the heat,turning on or off a hot water tank, switching up power sources, or charging electronic devices, like cars.</description>

      <description>National and international level statistics that report macroeconomic indicators, like nominal and real inflation, international transactionflows, and trade statistics, are relied on by market participants, policy makers and stakeholders as inputs to critical decisions. Moreoften than not, macroeconomic statistics are taken as reliable, after-all, those are our official statistics, right?. But just how reliableare they? Unfortunately, the answer is that aligning statistics with underlying realities is a challenging task, and mainstreammacroeconomic statistics should, even in the best of cases, be taken with a grain of salt.</description>

      <description>Big data means billions if not trillions of observations recorded daily. Sophisticated data infrastructuresand advanced algorithms reveal new insights into our fast changing world, but only for those massive organizations with the transactionfrequency and the know how to extract them, right?
The question is one of relevance. While big data benefits for large organizations are readily tangible--like in the casewhere retailers want to know when customers are more likely to purchase which products, or what optimal prices will move discounted productsin a set time frame--smaller organizations sometimes just don&#39;t see how the data revolution is important to them.</description>

      <description>Data science improves organizational function, but it isn&#39;t always cheap. Scientific data analysis enables organizations to develop moreinternally efficient business systems. They can more easily reach potential stakeholders and engage them. Data informed organizations canprepare forward, more accurately refine and refocus strategies, and more effectively manage risks. The problem is data science itself is aninvestment heavy human resource, and those costs are passed on to the employer. Trainees need a strong background in probability andstatistics, and expertise in a speciality subject, like political science, medicine, engineering, or economics.</description>

      <description>What is economic policy?If economics can be described as the study of the allocation of scarce resources among agents, economic policy can bedescribed as the public rules and regulations that guide that allocation. Wherever a society is governed with laws, there will be laws thatinfluence the economic prosperity of constituents, producers, and suppliers, as well as the distribution of resources among agents withinthe economy. Those rules constitute economic policy.</description>

      <description>What is maths programming?Mathematical programming, or computational programming, is the process of translating mathematically representableproblems into computer languages then harnessing the power of computers to solve them. Along with the Internet, and task facilitation,mathematical programming is probably the most important contribution from the modern computer to human evolution. There are many kinds ofmathematical programming techniques. Among these are: linear and non-linear programming, integer programming, mixed complementary problems,networks, goal programming, multiple objective optimization, queuing theory, regression analysis, and many more.</description>

      <description>What is decision analysis?Decision analysis is a subcategory of decision science. Ultimately, all data science could be classified as decisionscience, because the entire point of data analytics and informatics is to enable better decision making processes to yield better outcomesfrom decisions. While decision science and decision analysis cannot eliminate the possibility of sub-optimal outcomes, they are inthemselves useful if not mandatory processes. They can, for example, enable teams or decision makers to move forward with confidence intheir assessments of decision variable behaviour across decision parameters, and thus with more reasonable expectation of probable outcomes.</description>

      <description>What is optimizationOptimization is about making choices that lead to first best outcomes. Mathematically,optimization is usually described with differential calculus, though when functions are linear, and problems are adequately fit substitutioncan lead to optimal solutions. In mathematics, optimization first requires the delineation of an objective function, a dependent functionmeant to be maximized or minimized through variations in the independent functions that predict it. Solving optimization problems thereforerequires identifying maximum or minimum points on the objective function and qualifying those points as local or global maximums orminimums.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudnine.github.io/archives/2016-01-19-what-are-macroeconomics/</guid>
      <description>What is macroeconomicsMacroeconomics is the field of economics that deals with aggregated quantities. Microeconomics, for example, might dealwith firm level economics, while macroeconomics might deal with aggregate firms level economics, the economics of all the firms in aneconomy together. Macroeconomics therefore includes the study of national level and supranational level economics.
What kind of indicators are macroeconomic?Macroeconomic indicators include trade indicators, like the trade balance, and trade openness, but also indicators thatdescribe other facets of the economy.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudnine.github.io/archives/2018-01-18-what-is-international-trade/</guid>
      <description>What is international trade?International trade is the movement of goods across national borders. Because bilateral exchange rates change frequently,international trade is watched closely by national and supranational governments. Small changes in currency pair spreads can impact themovement of goods across borders and, as a consequence, the health of a nation&#39;s domestic industry and its employment levels.
How do organizations measure international trade?Physical goods (commodity trade) are tracked by governments when they enter various economic and trade zones within aneconomy.</description>

      <description>What is modelling?Modelling is an important part of decision science. Modellers make simplified representations of reality to producejudgements about reality and guide real decisions. Models can be abstract and theoretical, or data driven and empirical. Both categories canbe prescriptive, predictive, or descriptive.
Why model?Modelling is a cost-effective way to test the successes and failures of potential projects without committing large-scaleresources. Modelling is also useful as means of building support necessary to successfully launch projects.</description>

      <description>What are statistics?Statistics are transformations of data through calculation. While in theory any calculation done with data yields astatistic, in practice statistics are associated with scientific and field specific calculations. For example, during preparation phase yourdata is frequently explored and analysed using simple plotting techniques that present meaningful descriptive statistics from the data ordata subset, like the mean, median, and/or quartile ranges. As another example, in macroeconomics, various calculations with data yield wellknown statistics like GDP, inflation, or trade balance by sector.</description>

      <description>What is data wrangling?Data wrangling is the process of preparing data for analysis or computation. It includes transforming data into variousformats and statistical derivations, cleaning data to account for missing observations, clumsy data types, or outright errors, and arrangingdata into workable categorized data sets.
When should data be cleaned?Anyone working with data knows it needs to be cleaned many times along the data pipeline. After data is collected, itmust be wrangled before it is stored.</description>

      <description>What is data science?The science of data promises to change the world, but many of us do not know what data science is. This segement gives you our answer.
Data science is the science of data analytics in the context of scientific query. The data scientist first asksscientific questions, then gathers data relevant to those questions, and finally applies a variety of computer processes and statistical andprobabilistic theories to derive answers to those questions.</description>
