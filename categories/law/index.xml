      <description>Forgive me for pointingout the obvious, which you surely already know, but I see no harm in expanding on the Assange trial and hope you will at least thank me for not postingyet another picture of toilet paper.
First, note the image to the right says &#34;Journalism is not a Crime.&#34; It does not say &#34;Do not extradite Julian Assange.&#34; I&#39;dlike more information, but I&#39;m not in a position to pick sides.</description>

A new breed of data savvy lawyers are entering legalcircles everywhere and bringing with them an inertia from new technologies.
Firstly, the legal profession stands to gain from those data driven insights that are common across organizations, likemore accurately targeted marketing, more informed case selection, more efficient internal procedures, and pricing models that minimize bothlosses of producer surplus, and dead-weight losses.</description>
