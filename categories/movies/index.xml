      <description>Nothing, but it could have been worse. Actually, I got bored and didn&#39;t watch it all. I&#39;m writing about it here because there were a couple of things I liked. I&#39;ll tell you about those shortly.
First, disclaimer: I didn&#39;t watch any of the Cloverfield series. They must have been good though, because they made a lot of money. The box office from the first one, &#34;Cloverfield,&#34; released in 2008, something like tripled cost.</description>
