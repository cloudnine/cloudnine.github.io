It's also distinct
from their usurp-tuous message, which is somewhat synonymous with that of those rebellious femmes "Pussy Riot". Blended between, and around, their
radically satirical bathroom-stall lyrics are a rather impressive display of clever and cantankerously harmonious notes.
What they've done here is nothing less than brilliant. They've served up a deliciously tangy earful that's not bad to listen to every once in awhile.</description></item></channel></rss>
