      <description>On September 19th, 1783, at the royal palace in Versailles, Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier introduced the King and Queen of France to their redoubtable 500lb invention, a curious brightly painted contraption of sackcloth and paper, wrapped in a fish net and held together with buttons.
