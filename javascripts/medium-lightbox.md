html

<figure class="half left zoom-effect">
    <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder" >
        <div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 50%;"></div>
        <img class="img" data-width="900" data-height="450" src="image.jpg">
    </div>
</figure>
To do some calculations some attributes are necessary:

data-width: the real width of the image.
data-height: the real height of the image.
To the div with aspect-ratio-fill class is applied a padding-bottom that is the aspect ratio of the image. The aspect ratio percentage is found with [(height/width)*100] formula.
Initialize plugin

Option
MediumLightbox('figure.zoom-effect', {
    margin:40
});
Margin - default: 20 - Margin in px applied to the image in zoomed view.
