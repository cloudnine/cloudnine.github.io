      <description>As Krugman might say, &#34;...it&#39;s in the market, stupid.&#34; The most influential economy in the world is poised to raiseinterest rates, but not because of inflation. Central banks in major parts of the world are still at the zero bound, and core prices arebehaving as they should when targeted only because liquidity is trapped on balance sheets as inventory. What happened? Why did monetaryeasing take half a decade to jump-start the US dollar economy?</description>
