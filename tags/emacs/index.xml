      <description>Directly below are the subheadings to the first main heading of my initialization file, see my last post Emacs Configuration Overview. I&#39;ll go through the lines of code in order, but remember, the line numbers you see in Hugo&#39;s code block css styling are relative to the code on this page not the emacs initialization file [Hugo is the Static Content Management System based on GO I used to make this blog].</description>

Atom, for example, has some super useful snippet packages. You can convert them into Yasnippet format (an Emacs snippet package), but it&#39;s a hassle.</description>
