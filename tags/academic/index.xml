      <description>Abstract This paper analyzes the effects of trade liberalization on productivity at the sector level. This is done with a multivariable regression of relative gross labour productivity on sector trade, between the U.S. and Canada, relative to total trade, between Canada and the world. A set of before and after treatment variables are used to distinguish the difference between the effect of trade openness before the NAFTA preferential trade agreement and after the agreement.</description>

      <description>Abstract This paper reviews a variety of academic publications, including those from authors who produced gravity models, and presents trade arguments for and against Lithuanian accession to the European Monetary Union (EMU). While the results prompt the author to argue in favour of accession, there is no commentary on either the benefits of reduced default risk or the costs of potential negative externalities like declines in living conditions or increased brain drain and population exodus that could result if accession causes tax increases, higher unemployment or lowered government expenditure.</description>

      <description>In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, intrinsic political and economic challenges have raised questions about the survival of the European Monetary Union (EMU). To the extent that we can view the crisis as an asymmetric employment shock, we are reminded that national level barriers to labour mobility do not make for strong optimal currency area arguments. In addition, price level inflexibility and homogenous borrowing costs across the EMU have resulted in continued high unemployment and disparities in real exchange rates that cannot be met by nominal revaluations (1).</description>
