      <description>Okay, Obama is in the news, he&#39;s made friends, he&#39;s made headlines, he&#39;s made history-he&#39;s everywhere. The world stands in awe. Democracyhas been authenticated. It&#39;s no longer a form of government that claims to champion the cause of the marginalized while craftily concealingthe domination of the under-privileged by autocrats and oligarchs---it&#39;s the real the thing: true government by popular representation.
And it&#39;s clear that people view Obama as a human being--- someone with a conscience, who believes that America stands for democracy,liberty, freedom, and the rule of law.</description>
