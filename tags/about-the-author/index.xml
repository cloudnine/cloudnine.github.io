      <description>Below are some notes covering among other things why I got into Emacs, where I got my version, and how my configuration is organized. As mentioned before, other text editors in use today, like Atom, IntelliJ Idea, or Sublime Text are awesome, and offer also great selections of unique packages. Atom, for example, has some super useful snippet packages. You can convert them into Yasnippet format (an Emacs snippet package), but it&#39;s a hassle.</description>

      <description>Cloud Nine is a blog about &#39;stuff.&#39; Yes, exactly, &#39;stuff,&#39; in all its ambiguous grandeur. &#39;Stuff&#39; can mean pretty much anything, but I&#39;m talking about a special kind of stuff, that kind that makes us human. You know like, &#39;aack,&#39; philosophy, ethics, motivation, and work. Or, success, family, friends, and community. Okay, you get the point. I have a license to write about pretty much anything here. And even though you can see from the menu items on the navigation bar that Cloud Nine is about sciency stuff, and books; and even though I&#39;m going to warn you right now it&#39;s also about computers; rest assured, the motivation section is meant for everyone.</description>
