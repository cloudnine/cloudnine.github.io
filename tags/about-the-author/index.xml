      <description>Yesterday wasn&#39;t a typical day. It was my birthday. I took a brush to the whiteboard and replaced all the TODOs with thewords &#34;Read Python,&#34; in an extra large blue custom font I&#39;m calling &#39;meander.&#39; I packed one of the python books in with a couple of othersand took the train to the library. My idea of a good time really is a quiet nook and a well written book.</description>

      <description>Below are some notes covering among other things why I got into Emacs, where I got my version, and how my configuration isorganized. As mentioned before, other text editors in use today, like Atom, IntelliJ Idea, or SublimeText are awesome, and offer also great selections of unique packages. Atom, for example, has some super useful snippet packages. You canconvert them into Yasnippet format (an Emacs snippet package), but it&#39;s a hassle.</description>
