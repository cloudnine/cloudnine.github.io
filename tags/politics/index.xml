      <description>Rarely have free trade debaters--on all sides--had better opportunities to wag tongues. The long-standing era of free trade deals that in Canada started with the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement in 1987 (CUSFTA), superseded by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, has run squarely into a pronounced US protectionist revival that glaringly threatens the now deeply integrated global trade regime. This is not, by the way, an uncontested protectionist movement.</description>

      <description>It is honorable to respect all peoples, given they are not acting outside the social contract, nor seeking to usurp unjustly another&#39;s rights or freedoms.
The law protects people in societies and enables societies to function. To the extent it remains to do so, it should be upheld at every turn. When there are laws that do not serve all citizens in a society equally, those laws should be challenged and amended.</description>

      <description>There is a 90% chance Hillary will win the Democratic nomination, Paul Krugman says, so Bernie has a responsibility to support Democrats and go easier on Hillary. Paul Krugman, &amp;ldquo;Feel The Math&amp;rdquo;
This is a tell-tale sign America as an institution is standing around scratching its head about the Bernie problem. What happens if Bernie hits the tipping point?
Here&#39;s what happens if Bernie Sanders goes to the White House: America stops.</description>

      <title>Dealing With The HST</title>

      <description>Protests across the province last month made it clear to British Columbians that the PST/GST harmonization announced on July 23 by Premier Gordon Campbell is not going over well. Former Premier Bill Vander Zalm grasped onto the issue like a life raft, presumably hoping to resurrect his long-thought dead but apparently still alive Social Credit initiatives. The NDP are joining Mr. Vander Zalm in the attack on the provincial Liberal for, perhaps, partisan reasons (it&#39;s worth nothing that New Democrats in prairies support the HST).</description>

      <description>Okay, Obama is in the news, he&#39;s made friends, he&#39;s made headlines, he&#39;s made history-he&#39;s everywhere. The world stands in awe. Democracy has been authenticated. It&#39;s no longer a form of government that claims to champion the cause of the marginalized while craftily concealing the domination of the under-privileged by autocrats and oligarchs---it&#39;s the real the thing: true government by popular representation.
And it&#39;s clear that people view Obama as a human being--- someone with a conscience, who believes that America stands for democracy, liberty, freedom, and the rule of law.</description>
