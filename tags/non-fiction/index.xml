      <description>J.P. Morgan: celebrated, powerfully unambiguous, oligarchicaly connected, pillar of American history. The man with the bushy furrowed brows, pudgy fat nose, and bulging adams apple. As a school boy, he was infirm, aloof, and disliked. As a business titan he had fingers in every corner of gilded America. He built the railway to the west. When Edison dumped Tesla on the street with a shovel - less a year or two of salary - Morgan signed him from his rescuers and put him back in the money.</description>

      <description>What do Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes, and Roger Penrose have in common? Well, certainly there must have been something, but it wasn&#39;t the content of their books. Smith and Keynes were economists, Penrose is a mathematical physicist. Still, I&#39;ve mentioned them here together because in a way I&#39;m telling a story and Roger Penrose&#39;s book is to me right now in some ways what Keynes&#39;s book once was. Let&#39;s start with me and Adam Smith.</description>

      <title>Business the Ultimate Resource</title>

      <description>This is a fantastic book. I bought it when it was first published (in 2002), and my copy is well used. The idea seems to be basically to publish everything you need to know about business, that a book can teach you, between two covers. The reality of course is that there are a lot of books on business, and many of them are inspiring and educational. Moreover, books like this one are great for people who want to understand key processes in big business, and even helpful for those who want to build better small business, but, despite what Chekhov said about it, business is not about processes, buzz words, or other people&#39;s money, it&#39;s about value exchange.</description>
