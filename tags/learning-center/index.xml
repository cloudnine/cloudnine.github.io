      <description>J.P. Morgan: celebrated, powerfully unambiguous, oligarchically connected, pillar of American history. The man with the bushyfurrowed brows, pudgy fat nose, and bulging adams apple. As a school boy, he was infirm, aloof, and disliked. As a business titan his stubby fingers horned onevery corner of gilded America. He built the railway to the west. When Edison dumped Tesla on the street with a shovel - less a year or two of salary - Morganpicked him up and put him back in the money.</description>

 For those of you that come here for my emacs posts, don&#39;t worry, nothing has changed. I have been working onmultidisciplinary studies for over twenty years. I routinely work at several types of activities. These include psychology work, finance,data science, computer programming, writing, and now also vlogging.</description>

      <description>What doAdam Smith, John Maynard Keynes, and Roger Penrose have in common? Well, certainly there must have been something, but it wasn&#39;t the contentof their books. Smith and Keynes were economists, Penrose is a mathematical physicist. Still, I&#39;ve mentioned them here together because in away I&#39;m telling a story and Roger Penrose&#39;s book is to me right now in some ways what Keynes&#39;s book once was. Let&#39;s start with me and AdamSmith.</description>

      <description>This is afantastic book. I bought it when it was first published (in 2002), and my copy is well used. The idea seems to be basically to publisheverything you need to know about business, that a book can teach you, between two covers. The reality of course is that thereare a lot of books on business, and many of them are inspiring and educational. Moreover, books like this one are great for people who want tounderstand key processes in big business, and even helpful for those who want to build better small business, but, despite what Chekhovsaid about it, business is not about processes, buzz words, or other people&#39;s money, it&#39;s about value exchange.</description>

      <description>Psychologists do important work, but it doesn&#39;t take one to know that people operate a lot like computers. We&#39;ve got codeinside that issues a response when stimulated. The more you know the person, the more you know what responses to expect. In any organization teambuilding improves organizational outcomes. But what is going on when team members bond?
Alignment is a concept that explains what&#39;s going on. Let each line in this chart represent a person; but more than that, let itrepresent their psychology, the millions of associations their mind contains between images andexpectations, words and definitions, and information and responses.</description>

      <description>Below are some notes covering among other things why I got into Emacs, where I got my version, and how my configuration isorganized. As mentioned before, other text editors in use today, like Atom, IntelliJ Idea, or SublimeText are awesome, and offer also great selections of unique packages. Atom, for example, has some super useful snippet packages. You canconvert them into Yasnippet format (an Emacs snippet package), but it&#39;s a hassle.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s All This About Text Editors?I always used to ask, why do people post about their text-editors? These days I know the reason. Computers are lightening fast, using themisn&#39;t. You need to leave what you are doing to turn on another piece of software. You have to search for files. You&#39;re constantly having toremember how a process works, or search around the IDE to figure out how to do something again.</description>

Investing is all about timing. The five simple words that contain the secret to investing like a billionaire are: The time value of money.While money doesn&#39;t exactly grow on trees, it does actually grow like a tree-a big, green, Christmasy [acceptable?], money tree. Yes, mostpeople eventually learn the sheer power of savings and compound interest, but few people learn it early enough to use it wisely.</description>

      <description>What is an ETF?Electronically traded funds are close-end funds that trade on a stock exchange. They are managed through a creation andredemption scheme that ties their contents to those of an index, or selection of investments that meet specific criteria. The value of anETF is determined by market forces. When the value deviates from the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying investments, traders trade onthe arbitrage opportunity.</description>

The law protects people in societies and enables societies to function. To theextent it remains to do so, it should be upheld at every turn. When there arelaws that do not serve all citizens in a society equally, those laws should bechallenged and amended.</description>

      <description>Numerous studies have examined what intangible and tangible factors might cause one organization to outperform othersover a period of time. There is no question that ideas and talent are invaluable, but it is no longer any surprise that the single mostimportant factor affecting organizational performance is organizational psychology. Here are a few examples:
Ray Dalio runs Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. In Connecticut, he&#39;s got 1500 people,some of whom are the best and brightest brains in the financial sector, but does Ray cite his PhDs, research acumen, and process as hisnumber one a comparative advantage?</description>

      <description>Information technologies and the data they create are changing the world rapidly in a multitude of ways. The legalprofession, one of the most traditional and adverse to change, is beginning to adapt. A new breed of data savvy lawyers are entering legalcircles everywhere and bringing with them an inertia from new technologies.
Firstly, the legal profession stands to gain from those data driven insights that are common across organizations, likemore accurately targeted marketing, more informed case selection, more efficient internal procedures, and pricing models that minimize bothlosses of producer surplus, and dead-weight losses.</description>

      <description>What is economic policy?If economics can be described as the study of the allocation of scarce resources among agents, economic policy can bedescribed as the public rules and regulations that guide that allocation. Wherever a society is governed with laws, there will be laws thatinfluence the economic prosperity of constituents, producers, and suppliers, as well as the distribution of resources among agents withinthe economy. Those rules constitute economic policy.</description>

      <description>What is maths programming?Mathematical programming, or computational programming, is the process of translating mathematically representableproblems into computer languages then harnessing the power of computers to solve them. Along with the Internet, and task facilitation,mathematical programming is probably the most important contribution from the modern computer to human evolution. There are many kinds ofmathematical programming techniques. Among these are: linear and non-linear programming, integer programming, mixed complementary problems,networks, goal programming, multiple objective optimization, queuing theory, regression analysis, and many more.</description>

      <description>What is decision analysis?Decision analysis is a subcategory of decision science. Ultimately, all data science could be classified as decisionscience, because the entire point of data analytics and informatics is to enable better decision making processes to yield better outcomesfrom decisions. While decision science and decision analysis cannot eliminate the possibility of sub-optimal outcomes, they are inthemselves useful if not mandatory processes. They can, for example, enable teams or decision makers to move forward with confidence intheir assessments of decision variable behaviour across decision parameters, and thus with more reasonable expectation of probable outcomes.</description>

      <description>What is optimizationOptimization is about making choices that lead to first best outcomes. Mathematically,optimization is usually described with differential calculus, though when functions are linear, and problems are adequately fit substitutioncan lead to optimal solutions. In mathematics, optimization first requires the delineation of an objective function, a dependent functionmeant to be maximized or minimized through variations in the independent functions that predict it. Solving optimization problems thereforerequires identifying maximum or minimum points on the objective function and qualifying those points as local or global maximums orminimums.</description>

      <description>What is macroeconomicsMacroeconomics is the field of economics that deals with aggregated quantities. Microeconomics, for example, might dealwith firm level economics, while macroeconomics might deal with aggregate firms level economics, the economics of all the firms in aneconomy together. Macroeconomics therefore includes the study of national level and supranational level economics.
What kind of indicators are macroeconomic?Macroeconomic indicators include trade indicators, like the trade balance, and trade openness, but also indicators thatdescribe other facets of the economy.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudnine.github.io/archives/2018-01-18-what-is-international-trade/</guid>
      <description>What is international trade?International trade is the movement of goods across national borders. Because bilateral exchange rates change frequently,international trade is watched closely by national and supranational governments. Small changes in currency pair spreads can impact themovement of goods across borders and, as a consequence, the health of a nation&#39;s domestic industry and its employment levels.
How do organizations measure international trade?Physical goods (commodity trade) are tracked by governments when they enter various economic and trade zones within aneconomy.</description>

      <description>What is modelling?Modelling is an important part of decision science. Modellers make simplified representations of reality to producejudgements about reality and guide real decisions. Models can be abstract and theoretical, or data driven and empirical. Both categories canbe prescriptive, predictive, or descriptive.
Why model?Modelling is a cost-effective way to test the successes and failures of potential projects without committing large-scaleresources. Modelling is also useful as means of building support necessary to successfully launch projects.</description>

      <description>What are statistics?Statistics are transformations of data through calculation. While in theory any calculation done with data yields astatistic, in practice statistics are associated with scientific and field specific calculations. For example, during preparation phase yourdata is frequently explored and analysed using simple plotting techniques that present meaningful descriptive statistics from the data ordata subset, like the mean, median, and/or quartile ranges. As another example, in macroeconomics, various calculations with data yield wellknown statistics like GDP, inflation, or trade balance by sector.</description>

      <description>What is data wrangling?Data wrangling is the process of preparing data for analysis or computation. It includes transforming data into variousformats and statistical derivations, cleaning data to account for missing observations, clumsy data types, or outright errors, and arrangingdata into workable categorized data sets.
When should data be cleaned?Anyone working with data knows it needs to be cleaned many times along the data pipeline. After data is collected, itmust be wrangled before it is stored.</description>
