Modelling is an important part of decision science. Modellers make simplified representations of reality to produce
judgements about reality and guide real decisions. Models can be abstract and theoretical, or data driven and empirical. Both categories can
be prescriptive, predictive, or descriptive.
Why model?
Modelling is a cost-effective way to test the successes and failures of potential projects without committing large-scale
resources. Modelling is also useful as means of building support necessary to successfully launch projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
