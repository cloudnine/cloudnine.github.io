      <description>Yesterday wasn&#39;t a typical day. It was my birthday. I took a brush to the whiteboard and replaced all the TODOs with thewords &#34;Read Python,&#34; in an extra large blue custom font I&#39;m calling &#39;meander.&#39; I packed one of the python books in with a couple of othersand took the train to the library. My idea of a good time really is a quiet nook and a well written book.</description>
