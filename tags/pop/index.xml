      <description>Poppy, punky, alternative sounds you&#39;re probably already familiar with through their advertising business. They&#39;re not so far on Wiki yet, but below are descriptions from their webpage.      &#34;Midnight Riot is the edgy duo brought to life by soulful rocker Emily Kopp, and guitarist/producer Justin Beckler. Drawing from their love of pop and old school indie rock, their creations feature good old-fashioned guitar riffs, room-shaking stomps and claps, and hooks that sink so deep you&#39;ll be humming them for weeks.</description>
