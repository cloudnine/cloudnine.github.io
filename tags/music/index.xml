Actually, I got bored and
didn't watch it all. I'm writing about it here because there were a couple of things I liked. I'll tell you about those shortly.
First, disclaimer: I didn't watch any of the Cloverfield series. They must have been good though, because they made a lot of money. The box office from the first one, "Cloverfield," released in 2008, something like tripled cost.</description></item><item><title>Music Playlist Feature - Le Tigre</title><link>https://cloudnine.github.io/motivation/2020-02-10-playlist-le-tigre/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnine.github.io/motivation/2020-02-10-playlist-le-tigre/</guid><description>The "Le Tigre" sound is uniquely cacophonous, punky, and at the same time invigoratingly rebellious. It's also distinct
from their usurp-tuous message, which is somewhat synonymous with that of those rebellious femmes "Pussy Riot". Blended between, and around, their
radically satirical bathroom-stall lyrics are a rather impressive display of clever and cantankerously harmonious notes.
What they've done here is nothing less than brilliant. They've served up a deliciously tangy earful that's not bad to listen to every once in awhile.</description></item><item><title>Hello Music Playlist - Music You Can Work To</title><link>https://cloudnine.github.io/about/02-12-2019-hello-music-playlist-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnine.github.io/about/02-12-2019-hello-music-playlist-work/</guid><description>Preamble

I knew Saki through my highschool gang's band Omnibol.
He was straight-up, humble, and authentic - and he had a monster talent. Didn't see him around much over the years but when I did we'd gel. Rest In Peace Saki.</description></item></channel></rss>
