      <description>Songs:Tokyo Megaplex - Pinapple House Party, The Hole Foods Experience, Ahhhhh, The Price Is Wrong  Playlist Title:&amp;nbsp;Tokyo MegaplexAs I understand, Tokyo Megaplex is a Brooklyn musical artist. I listened to a few of their tracks and enjoyed these ones.If you can listen beyond the Hip Hop (a decidedly specific segment of the musical spectrum), they could go nicely with augmented reality. Augmented Reality is a concept developed in recent years by designer KEIICHIMATSUDA.</description>

      <description>Poppy, punky, alternative sounds you&#39;re probably already familiar with through their advertising business. They&#39;re not so far on Wiki yet, but below are descriptions from their webpage.&#34;Midnight Riot is the edgy duo brought to life by soulful rocker Emily Kopp, and guitarist/producer Justin Beckler. Drawing from their love of pop and old school indie rock, their creations feature good old-fashioned guitar riffs, room-shaking stomps and claps, and hooks that sink so deep you&#39;ll be humming them for weeks.</description>

      <description>Nothing, but it could have been worse. Actually, I got bored anddidn&#39;t watch it all. I&#39;m writing about it here because there were a couple of things I liked. I&#39;ll tell you about those shortly.
First, disclaimer: I didn&#39;t watch any of the Cloverfield series. They must have been good though, because they made a lot of money. The box office from the first one, &#34;Cloverfield,&#34; released in 2008, something like tripled cost.</description>
