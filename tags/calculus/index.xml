      <description>What is optimizationOptimization is about making choices that lead to first best outcomes. Mathematically,optimization is usually described with differential calculus, though when functions are linear, and problems are adequately fit substitutioncan lead to optimal solutions. In mathematics, optimization first requires the delineation of an objective function, a dependent functionmeant to be maximized or minimized through variations in the independent functions that predict it. Solving optimization problems thereforerequires identifying maximum or minimum points on the objective function and qualifying those points as local or global maximums orminimums.</description>
