      <description>The data revolution is impacting government in a number of ways. The foremost is known as &#39;smart government&#39;, which is a reference to the way governments manage the data they have and the way they make that management and the services that go with it available to their clients (constituents in a democracy). The second impact, also intelligent, is known as the &#39;smart city.&#39;
Smart government is a concept championed by the Estonian government (our example), which won the United Nations Public Service Award, in the category of Promoting Whole of Government Approaches in the Information Age, for their online business registry.</description>

      <description>Enhanced financial regulation typically comes with intended and unintended consequences. Directive 2004/39/EC, the Market for Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), for example, successfully increased competition among financial instrument trading organizations in Europe. This brought down consumer prices and narrowed margins. It also sent market participants looking to move large blocks of shares into dark pools, where trade data are not made public.
There will be intended and unintended consequences from MiFID&#39;s successor, MiFID2, which is anticipated to be in effect by January 2018.</description>

      <description>Abstract This paper analyzes the effects of trade liberalization on productivity at the sector level. This is done with a multivariable regression of relative gross labour productivity on sector trade, between the U.S. and Canada, relative to total trade, between Canada and the world. A set of before and after treatment variables are used to distinguish the difference between the effect of trade openness before the NAFTA preferential trade agreement and after the agreement.</description>
