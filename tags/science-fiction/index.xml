      <description>Algis Budrys, was a wonderful Science Fiction author from back in the day, when men wanted to land on the moon and science fiction was the latest greatest thing. I found a story of his in a magazine my father had been reading. His name was circled in pen. My father didn&#39;t tell war stories, or talk about being Lithuanian, but I found signs of Lithuanianism everywhere - and my dad had a thing for science fiction.</description>

      <description>Dune, undoubtedly one of the best science fiction series ever written, is scheduled to return to the screen this November (2020). No film has yet done the book justice in any way. Like a lot of books written in the days when people read things, it&#39;s a long one. Frank Herbert spent six long years writing thing. I only wish I the time to read it again; but then, I live in a real-estate bubble, there&#39;s no time for anything.</description>
