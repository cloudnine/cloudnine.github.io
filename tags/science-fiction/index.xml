      <description>Nothing, but it could have been worse. Actually, I got bored and didn&#39;t watch it all. I&#39;m writing about it here because there were a couple of things I liked. I&#39;ll tell you about those shortly.
First, disclaimer: I didn&#39;t watch any of the Cloverfield series. They must have been good though, because they made a lot of money. The box office from the first one, &#34;Cloverfield,&#34; released in 2008, something like tripled cost.</description>

      <description>Algis Budrys, was a wonderful Science Fiction author from back in the day, when men wanted to land on the moon and science fiction was the latest greatest thing. When I was a teenager, I found a story of his in a magazine my father had been reading. His name was circled in pen. My father didn&#39;t tell war stories, or talk about being Lithuanian, but I found signs of Lithuanianism everywhere - and my dad had a thing for science fiction.</description>

      <description>Dune, undoubtedly one of the best science fiction series ever written, is scheduled to return to the screen this November (2020). No film has yet done the book justice, in any way. It was the first of it&#39;s kind. A truly sprawling science fiction saga. New worlds. New empires. Humans and aliens, locked together a terrific tale of espionage, science, warfare, and trade. It has all the literary foundations for a film series to rival &#34;</description>
